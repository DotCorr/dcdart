# DCDart

A native systems language with Dart's syntax and type system, compiled AOT to native code — no VM,
no interpreter, no JIT, no tracing GC. Memory is managed by ARC with compile-time elision and a local
cycle collector. C ABI at every boundary.

Everything buildable — compiler pipeline, runtime, examples, tests, and the full design-decision
record — lives under [`core/`](core/README.md). Start there.

**Setting it up, or testing it in VS Code:** [`core/docs/testing-setup.md`](core/docs/testing-setup.md)
— prerequisites, the fresh-clone step that a clone cannot build without, a first program end to end,
and the two behaviours (byte-counted `.length`, trapping arithmetic) that surprise people.

## The two numbers that define the project

1. **ARC overhead vs. C.** Target ≤10% geometric mean. Gated at M3.
2. **Undefined symbols in a `@bare` object file.** Target: zero, checked mechanically on every change.

## License

DCDart is released under the [Apache License 2.0 with LLVM exceptions](LICENSE) — the same licensing
terms the LLVM project uses, chosen deliberately for a compiler: the Apache grant covers patents
necessarily infringed by the toolchain itself, and the LLVM-style exception guarantees that any
program compiled with `dcc` is entirely yours — no conditions of the license attach to the output,
object form, or binaries you build and distribute. Copyright © 2026 DotCorr.

## Status

M0 (Kernel IR seam) and M1 (type model) are done and verified end to end. M2 (ARC) has real
allocation/retain/release, aliasing, function calls, heap-typed signatures and fields, `@owned`
parameters, a destructor cascade, weak references, a first elision pass, verified recursion, scalar
local reassignment, and real `while`-loop control flow — all backed by a real `dcc build` →
freestanding link → run cycle, not stubs. See [`core/README.md`](core/README.md) for the current
target/ADR count and [`core/docs/known-gaps.md`](core/docs/known-gaps.md) for what's honestly still
missing.
