// `dc-objdump --arc <source.dart>` (CLAUDE.md's testing rules: "Anything
// touching ARC codegen also needs an elision test: assert the expected
// number of dc_retain/dc_release calls in the emitted IR... dc-objdump
// --arc prints the counts.") This tool has been a documented obligation
// since M2's first ARC slice (ADR-0015/0016) but was never actually built
// until now -- a real compliance gap against this project's own testing
// rules, closed here rather than left unaddressed indefinitely.
//
// Counts at the DC-IR level (`lowerToDCModule`'s own output), not the
// backend's emitted LLVM text or the final object file: this project's
// Retain/Release/MakeWeak/WeakLoad/DropWeak are all INLINED at the backend
// stage (ADR-0009/0015's "recognized intrinsics lowered inline" -- there
// is no `call @dc_retain` symbol anywhere in the object file to count).
// DC-IR is the one real, meaningful place "how many ARC operations does
// this function have" is a countable, stable question -- and it's
// literally what dcc-lower ITSELF calls "the emitted IR" it produces
// (core/dcc-lower/README.md's own framing: Kernel IR -> dcc-lower ->
// DC-IR). Once elision (docs/known-gaps.md GAP-0017 item 2, M3 scope)
// exists, THIS is where its effect becomes visible: the same source
// program should show smaller Retain/Release counts here after an elision
// pass runs than before one exists.
//
// Usage:
//   cd core/dc-objdump && dart pub get   # once
//   dart bin/dc_objdump.dart --arc path/to/source.dart
//
// Exit codes: 0 success, 64 usage error, 65 input file not found,
// 1 lowering failed (mirrors dcc's own exit-code convention).

const String _usage = '''
Usage: dc-objdump --arc [--no-elide] <source.dart>

Lowers <source.dart> through dcc-lower and prints, per function, how many
of each ARC-relevant DC-IR instruction it contains: Alloc, Retain,
Release, MakeWeak, WeakLoad, DropWeak.

  --why        Report, per function, WHY pending retains failed to pair --
               and which pass removed the ones that did not:
               blockLimited (reached the end of a block unmatched, and the
               cross-block frontier pass could not place it either),
               opaqueLimited (a non-transparent Call, an IndirectCall or a
               weak op invalidated it -- ADR-0066's transparency summary is
               what shrank this class), releaseLimited (a surviving Release,
               ADR-0063 -- needs escalation 0011), elided/crossBlock/nullOps
               (removed per-block, by the frontier pass, or as a null no-op,
               ADR-0066). Counts are attempts, not distinct pairs.
               "Elision removes 5% here" does not say what to fix; this does.

  --no-elide   Skip ADR-0025's redundant-pair elision, so the counts are what
               lowering PRODUCED rather than what survived. Diffing the two
               runs is how you measure what the pass actually removes on a
               given program -- which nothing could do before, because
               elision ran unconditionally inside lowering and this tool only
               ever saw the post-elision numbers. "The pass fires" is proved
               by its unit tests; "the pass removes N of M pairs HERE" is a
               different question and decides whether an ARC benchmark is
               measuring ARC or measuring a missing optimisation.
