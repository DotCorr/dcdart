#
# Conformance target for string slices (ADR-0053).
#
# Two assertions carry this target:
#
#   utf8Len   "héllo" is 6 BYTES and 5 Dart UTF-16 code units. Spec §7 names
#             that the largest single source of semantic drift from upstream
#             Dart, so it is asserted rather than documented -- a `.length`
#             that returned 5 would be Dart-correct and DCDart-wrong.
#   sumBytes  walks a literal's bytes through `.address` and sums them, which
#             proves the pointer reaches real .rodata content rather than a
#             plausible number. A length check alone would pass on a slice
#             pointing anywhere at all.
#
# Usage:

# Exit status: 0 on PASS, 1 on FAIL, 2 on harness usage/setup error.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Step 1c — INTERNING, asserted on the emitted IR rather than inferred.
#
# `sameAddress()` comparing equal at runtime is already evidence, but it is
# NEGATIVE evidence: it proves two addresses matched, and a compiler that
# emitted two globals which the linker later merged would also match. So the
# module is inspected directly -- the bytes of "shared" must appear under
# exactly ONE global. Byte-identical globals are not unnamed_addr (ADR-0040),
# so a second one would survive to the object and this would catch it.
