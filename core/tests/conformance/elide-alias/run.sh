#
# Conformance target for GAP-0054 / ADR-0063: elision pass 3 must not
# delete a retain/release pair across a SURVIVING `Release` of a value
# that may ALIAS the retained object.
#
# This is a MISCOMPILATION regression target, and it is worth saying what
# that means for how it is written. Before ADR-0063, `dcc build` at -O2
# turned `examples/m3-elide-alias/elide_alias.dart`'s `aliasBug` into a
# program that returned 198 where 110 is correct -- a read of freed memory
# whose slot had already been handed back out. It did that while
# `dc_heap_live` read zero on every call and every refcount balanced,
# because cancelling a retain/release pair frees the object exactly once;
# it just frees it far too early. NO LEAK TEST IN THIS REPO COULD SEE IT.
#
# So three things are asserted, and the third is the one that would have
# caught it:
#
#   1. FREESTANDING -- CLAUDE.md rule 1, over the bare-x86_64 object.
#   2. ARC COUNTS   -- exact per-function counts from `dc-objdump --arc`,
#      in BOTH directions. The pairs that must now survive, and -- just as
#      load-bearing -- the pair that must still be ELIDED, so that a
#      "fix" which quietly turned pass 3 into a no-op fails here rather
#      than passing everything and costing performance everywhere.
#   3. BEHAVIOUR    -- the values. 110, not 198.
#
# The link step goes through tests/conformance/_lib/hosted-link.sh, so this
# harness has NO Linux/x86-64 gate (GAP-0048).
#
# Usage:
#   bash core/tests/conformance/elide-alias/run.sh
#
# Exit status: 0 on PASS, 1 on FAIL, 2 on harness usage/setup error.

#   <exit>               release got, c, n, other
#
# `Retain got` and its release straddle the release of the old field
# value, which is THE SAME OBJECT under a different DCValue. retain=1 is
# the assertion: before ADR-0063 this read retain=0, and that zero was the
# use-after-free.
arc_is 'aliasBug' 'alloc=5 retain=1 release=5 makeweak=0 weakload=0 dropweak=0'

# releaseThroughDestructor. COUNT RE-PINNED retain=1 -> retain=0 by
# ADR-0068's run-atomic release matching, and the justification is owed in
# full because the previous pin was a deliberate ADR-0063 refusal:
#
#   The pair straddles `Release c`, and `Cell_dtor` releases `c.next` --
#   the release that can free the aliased object is not even syntactically
#   a release of a Node. ADR-0063 refused it because "no use follows the
#   aliasing release" was a fact about dcc-lower's emission order, asserted
#   in no file the pass could read. ADR-0068 cancels it because that fact
#   is now checked LOCALLY: all three releases are literally ADJACENT in
#   the block body (`Release n; Release c; Release got`, nothing between),
#   and NO USE FOLLOWS the run -- the last use (`got.n`) sits before it.
#   (2026-08-27 audit correction: this used to add "adjacent releases are
#   pure decrements that commute", which is FALSE -- `Release c` here
#   literally runs Cell_dtor, real code between "adjacent" releases. The
#   premises that carry the rule, per ADR-0068 as corrected: end-of-run
#   counts are order-independent (totals decide death, not order), and
#   adjacency guarantees no use is INTERLEAVED, so the earlier death the
#   reorder introduces is unobservable; sound while synthesized dtors are
#   field-releases only (ADR-0022) -- a dtor that could WeakLoad the
#   object, e.g. future user-defined dtors (spec section 3), would make
#   death time observable and re-refuse this shape.) GAP-0054's
#   original entry said this exact instance was safe and named this exact
#   reason; what changed is that the pass now PROVES it instead of assuming
#   it.
#
#   The dangerous version of the shape -- ANY use between the aliasing
#   release and the pair's release -- still refuses: aliasBug and
#   aliasBugNullable above (retain=1, the actual 198-vs-110 miscompilation
#   shapes) are the assertion of that, together with dc-elide's own
#   "use between the releases" negative unit test.

# --- The pair that MUST STILL BE ELIDED. ----------------------------------
#
# THIS LINE IS THE ANTI-NO-OP GUARD. A local alias whose retain reaches its
# own release with no release of anything in between is exactly what pass 3
# exists to remove, and it is untouched by ADR-0063. If this ever reads
# retain=1, the fix has been widened into "disable elision", which would
# pass every correctness check in the suite while costing real performance
# on every benchmark.

#
# Asserted so that the reason stays visible: a nullable field needs a null
# test to dereference, the test is a CondBranch, and pass 3 is single-block
# -- so the retain and its release were never in the same block and were
# never candidates. It was never nullability that made this safe.
