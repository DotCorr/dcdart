# Conformance target for MONOMORPHIZED GENERIC CLASSES
# (docs/decisions/0054-generic-classes.md, closing docs/known-gaps.md
# GAP-0040). Extends ADR-0052, which did generic FUNCTIONS.
#
# Four independent things are asserted, because no one of them catches the
# failures of the others:
#
#   1. FREESTANDING   -- CLAUDE.md rule 1, over the bare-x86_64 object.
#   2. SYMBOL TABLE   -- one specialization per instantiation, no template
#      symbol, and -- the ARC-critical one -- a destructor for Box<Node>
#      and NO destructor for Box<u64> or Box<u32>.
#   3. ARC COUNTS     -- exact Alloc/Retain/Release per function, read from
#      `dc-objdump --arc`. An elision regression is invisible at runtime.
#   4. BEHAVIOUR+LEAK -- values read back at the right width, and the heap
#      back to baseline across all three instantiations.
#
# The link step goes through tests/conformance/_lib/hosted-link.sh, so this
# harness has NO Linux/x86-64 gate (GAP-0048).
#
# Usage:

#
# Exit status: 0 on PASS, 1 on FAIL, 2 on harness usage/setup error.

#   Box<Node>(n)         Alloc                                 alloc 2

#   b.unwrap()           Retain got -- aliasing a borrowed
#                                      return into a local (ADR-0017)
#   return got.n         Release n, Release b, Release got
#
# ADR-0025's pass 3 USED TO delete the `got` retain/release pair -- nothing
# between them releases `got`, so it looked like a redundant alias round trip
# -- and this line used to assert the elided 1/2.
#
# CHANGED BY ADR-0063 to 2/3. This is an ATTRIBUTED loss of elision, not a
# re-pin to whatever the build now reports, and this function is where
# GAP-0054 was first noticed.
#
# `Release b` sits between the retain and its match, and `Release b` runs
# `Box$Node_dtor`, which releases `b.value` -- THE VERY OBJECT `got` aliases.
# So "no release of `got` in between" was true and beside the point: the
# object could reach zero anyway. It did not actually crash here, and the
# reason it did not is worth keeping: `got.n` is lowered BEFORE
# `_releaseHeapLocals` emits anything, so the freed object was never read.
# That is a property of how dcc-lower orders a return, in a different file,
# asserted nowhere. `examples/m3-elide-alias` is the same shape with the read
# moved after the release, and it returned 198 instead of 110.
#
# So the +1/+1 here buys the removal of a use-after-free that this target
# could not have detected, since the counts balanced and the heap returned to
# baseline either way. Every other function in this file is unchanged.
#
# The result is still balanced, which is what makes it correct rather than
# merely larger: the Node carries +3 (its Alloc, the field-store retain, and
# the alias retain) against -3 (the local release, Box\$Node_dtor's release of
# the field, and the alias release), and the Box carries +1/-1.
# CHANGED AGAIN BY ADR-0066 (rule T) to 1/2, and the distinction between the
# two pairs is the whole point of the assertion now:
#
#   - The pair rule T recovers is the STORE-retain (`Retain b_value` around
#     `box.value = ...` / the unwrap call): its interval spans ONLY the call
#     to `Box$Node_unwrap`, which is proven refcount-transparent (its body is
#     PtrOffset/Load/Return -- no release, no weak op, no call), and contains
#     NO surviving Release. ADR-0063's invariant holds verbatim across it.
#   - The pair ADR-0063 refused -- `Retain got` straddling `Release b`, where
#     Box$Node_dtor releases b.value, THE VERY OBJECT `got` aliases -- was
#     still refused under ADR-0066 (`--why`: releaseLimited=1).
#
# CHANGED A THIRD TIME, to 0/1, BY ADR-0068 (run-atomic release matching),
# and the earlier warning here -- "if this line ever reads retain=0, treat it
# as a stop-the-line failure, not a count to re-pin" -- is answered rather
# than ignored. That warning guarded against LOSING the surviving-release
# refusal. The refusal machinery is intact: the elide-alias target's
# aliasBug/aliasBugNullable (the actual 198-vs-110 miscompilation shapes,
# where a USE follows the aliasing release) still pin retain=1, and dc-elide
# has a unit test refusing the use-between-the-releases shape by name. What
# cancels boxNode's `got` pair now is a NEW, separately argued rule, not a
# lost check: its three releases are literally ADJACENT
# (`Release b_value; Release b; Release got` -- nothing between them), and
# NO USE FOLLOWS the run, so the earlier death the reorder introduces is
# unobservable. (2026-08-27 audit correction: this comment used to argue
# "adjacent releases are pure decrements that commute" -- FALSE. A release
# hitting zero runs a destructor cascade -- here `Release b` literally runs
# Box$Node_dtor, which releases the very object `got` names -- so real code
# executes between "adjacent" releases and they do not commute. The
# load-bearing premises, per ADR-0068 as corrected: end-of-run counts are
# order-independent, totals decide death, not order; and adjacency
# guarantees no use is INTERLEAVED, while the last use, `got.n`, precedes
# the run and any post-run use of a run-killed object would have been a
# use-after-free in the original program too. Sound while synthesized
# destructors contain only field releases, ADR-0022 -- a destructor that
# could WeakLoad the affected object, e.g. future user-defined destructors
# under spec section 3, would make death time observable and invalidate the
# rule; that landing is the trigger to re-refuse this shape.) GAP-0054's own
# entry said this instance was safe and complained the reason lived in a
# different file, asserted nowhere; ADR-0068 makes the pass check the
# adjacency itself. The behavior checks above (the VALUES) remain the final
# arbiter that no read-after-free was introduced.
#
# Balance after the change: the Node carries +1 (its Alloc; both retains are
# now elided) against -1 (Box$Node_dtor's release of the field -- the local
# and alias releases are elided with their retains); the Box +1/-1 (its
# local release survives and cascades through the dtor).
