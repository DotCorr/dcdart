#
# The native-host conformance target. Every other harness in this directory
# links its @bare object with `-ffreestanding -nostdlib -static` plus a
# hand-written `_start.S`, and gates itself to Linux/x86-64 because that stub
# is Linux/x86-64-only (former GAP-0048). It had to: dcc hardcoded the
# freestanding triple `x86_64-unknown-none-elf`, so its output was not a
# native object for any real host OS.
#
# `dcc build --mode bare --target host` emits a native object for the machine
# running the build -- Mach-O on macOS, COFF on Windows, ELF on Linux. This
# harness is the mechanical proof: it links with PLAIN clang (no
# -ffreestanding, no -nostdlib, no -static, no entry stub) into an ordinary
# hosted C program with real libc and real printf, and runs it. THE ABSENCE
# OF A HOST GATE IS THE FEATURE UNDER TEST -- this harness is meant to run on
# macOS, Linux and Windows alike, so do not add one back.
#
# It also still requires the object to be FREESTANDING-CLEAN: targeting a
# native OS must not drag in a single libc symbol. A native target that
# needed libc would be a regression, not a feature.
#
# Usage:
#   bash core/tests/conformance/native-host/run.sh
#
# Exit status: 0 on PASS, 1 on FAIL, 2 on harness usage/setup error.
