# Conformance target for MEMORY BARRIERS (ADR-0056, GAP-0033).
#
# WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT ASSERT, stated first because the honest limit is
# unusual and reading a green result as more than it is would be worse than
# having no test.
#
# On x86-64, TSO already provides acquire and release ordering in hardware, so
# `fence acquire`, `fence release` and `fence acq_rel` correctly emit NO
# MACHINE INSTRUCTION. They are not decorative — they constrain the COMPILER,
# which is free to reorder the surrounding accesses without them — but the
# constraint is invisible in a disassembly. So:
#
#   * the DISCRIMINATOR for those three is the emitted LLVM IR (step 2), the
#     same resolution ADR-0041/GAP-0036 reached for `volatile`, and for the
#     same reason;
#   * `Ordering.seqCst` is the only one that reaches the machine, as `mfence`,
#     and it is the only one asserted in the disassembly (step 3);
#   * step 3 ALSO asserts the four cheap orderings emit NO `mfence`. That is
#     the assertion with teeth: an implementation that mapped every ordering
#     to seq_cst would satisfy every other check in this file while making
#     each barrier in the kernel cost an `mfence` it does not need.
#
# Step 6 is the DIFFERENTIAL GAP-0043 said was unwritable before ADR-0069:
# "without the fence the compiler reorders/elides these accesses, with it it
# does not". Until the device/ordinary pointer split, every access in the
# example went through a blanket-volatile `Pointer<T>.value` and the fences
# were redundant with a guarantee the pointer handed out for free. Ordinary
# `Pointer<T>` access is now plain (ADR-0069), so the fences are load-bearing
# and the differential is real: at -O2, `handoff`'s store-then-read-back is
# FORWARDED (the load disappears) when its `fence acqRel` is stripped from
# the IR, and survives when it is present. Both halves are asserted, so the
# test is demonstrably able to fail.
#
