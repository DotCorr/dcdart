#
# Conformance target for NON-CAPTURING CLOSURES (ADR-0057).
#
# Three assertions carry this target, and only the last one is about values:
#
#   HOISTING      Every local function must appear in the symbol table under a
#                 name qualified by its enclosing function, and no unqualified
#                 one may exist. Read from the object rather than inferred from
#                 behaviour: an implementation that inlined every local
#                 function into its caller would compute identical answers
#                 while quietly making `dbl` uncallable from two sites and
#                 making two same-named locals in different functions collide.
#
#   ELISION       `viaTopLevel` and `viaClosure` are the same program written
#                 two ways -- consuming callee at top level vs. inside the
#                 body. Their ARC instruction counts must be IDENTICAL, which
#                 is the whole claim of the narrow subset: a non-capturing
#                 closure call is a DIRECT call to a statically known callee,
#                 so `Call.argOwnership` is exact and dc-elide's pass-4
#                 call-consumed case fires through it unchanged. Asserted with
#                 `dc-objdump --arc`, because two programs can agree on every
#                 value while one retains and releases twice as often.
#
#                 This is the property docs/escalations/0008 says is LOST the
#                 moment a closure becomes a VALUE (argOwnership is then not
#                 derivable at all, so every such call site is an elision
#                 barrier). It is asserted here while it still holds, so that
#                 a later change which quietly gives it up cannot pass.
#
#   BEHAVIOUR     Ordinary values, plus 500 leak-free heap cycles, with
#                 `dc_heap_live` (ADR-0058) checked back at zero after every
#                 call, so a single leaked object per call could not
#                 survive.
