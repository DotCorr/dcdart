# Conformance target for HEAP-TYPED LOCALS DECLARED IN A LOOP BODY: the
# per-iteration ARC release policy.
#
# This target replaces a compile-time REFUSAL, so it has to assert the
# guarantee that refusal was protecting rather than just that the program now
# builds. The refusal ("naive ARC has no release policy for a loop back edge
# yet") was correct for ADR-0016/0017's policy: tracked locals were released
# only before a `return`, a back edge is not a `return`, so a heap local
# declared in a loop body leaked one object per iteration -- against the
# fixed 64-slot arena of the day (ADR-0015, superseded by ADR-0058) that was
# a SIGTRAP at iteration 65.
#
# So both halves are asserted, and neither alone is sufficient:
#
#   RUNTIME   1000 iterations each allocating one object, on every path out
#             of a loop body (fall-through, `continue`, `break`, `return`,
#             nested, and escaping into a loop-carried variable).
#             `dc_heap_live` -- the allocator's live-object count
#             (ADR-0058) -- is checked back at its baseline after every
#             call. That is an EXACT leak assertion at any heap size, and it
#             also catches a DOUBLE free (that decrements twice and drives
#             the count below baseline, where it wraps). Every computed
#             value is checked too -- a release placed one instruction too
#             early is a use-after-free that keeps `dc_heap_live` perfectly
#             balanced and only shows up in the arithmetic.
#
#   ARC       Exact per-function Alloc/Retain/Release at the DC-IR level via
#             `dc-objdump --arc` (CLAUDE.md's elision rule; ADR-0024). An
#             elision regression is invisible at runtime and catastrophic in
#             aggregate, and the specific regression this target exists to
#             catch -- a release silently dropped from ONE path, e.g. the
#             `continue` edge -- shows up here as a count and at runtime only
#             on the iterations that took it.

# Step 3 — ARC COUNTS, hand-derived per function.
#
# Read `release` as "number of release SITES", one per path out of the body,
# not as a per-iteration count. The runtime property -- releases equal allocs
# on every executed path -- is what Step 5 proves; what these numbers pin is
# that no path lost its release, which is precisely the regression a runtime
# check can only see on the iterations that actually take that path.
#
#   liveChain     Alloc (a `while` body local)                      alloc 1
#                 released on the body's fall-through             release 1
#   forChain      identical, except the release sits before the
#                 update block rather than the back edge          1 / 1
#   withContinue  one Alloc; TWO release sites, because the body
#                 has two exits -- the `continue` edge and the
#                 fall-through. A count of 1 here is the exact
#                 bug ADR-0050 warns about, reached through ARC
#                 instead of through the update clause.           1 / 2
#   withBreak     same shape: the `break` edge and the
#                 fall-through.                                    1 / 2
#   withReturn    the `return` path (released by _lowerReturn's
#                 whole-stack release, not by the loop) and the

#   nested        two Allocs, two releases: the inner local on the
#                 inner body's fall-through, the outer local on
#                 the outer body's -- which is the inner loop's
#                 exit block. Peak live is 2 for any n.            2 / 2
#   lastKept      Alloc 1. Retain 1 is the `Node? keep = null`
#                 declaration retaining the null. Retain 2 is the
#                 `keep = node` reassignment's retain of the new
#                 value. Release 4 = the reassignment's release of
#                 the PREVIOUS keep, the per-iteration release of
#                 the node local, plus one at each of the two
#                 returns.                                         2 / 4 (retain 2)
#
#                 CHANGED BY ADR-0063, from `retain 1 / release 3`.
#                 This is an ATTRIBUTED loss of elision, not a
#                 re-pin to whatever the build now reports.
#
#                 Pass 3 used to cancel the `keep = node` retain
#                 against the per-iteration release, because no
#                 release OF THAT VALUE appeared between them. The
#                 reassignment's release of the PREVIOUS keep does
#                 appear between them, and on the last iteration
#                 before the loop exits, the previous keep and the
#                 new one are values whose objects this pass cannot
#                 tell apart. GAP-0054's rule now invalidates the
#                 pending retain there, so the pair survives.
#
#                 It is +1 retain and +1 release STATICALLY, inside
#                 a loop body, and it is the price of the fix on
#                 this target. Nothing else in the file moves --
#                 the six other functions below are byte-identical,
#                 which is what says this is the aliasing rule
#                 firing and not the pass going quiet.
#
#                 BOUGHT BACK by ADR-0072 (2026-08-27): the price
#                 above was paid from ADR-0063 until escalation
#                 0011's Option C landed. The pair cancels again --
#                 soundly this time, `node` being provably fresh at
#                 the foreign release -- see the justification at
#                 the lastKept assertion below. Both history entries
#                 kept: this target has now carried the SAME pair
#                 refused-for-safety and recovered-by-proof, and the
#                 difference between those two states is the whole
#                 content of escalation 0011.

# CHANGED BY ADR-0066 (rule N) from retain=2: `Node? keep = null` emits a
# `Retain <NullRef>` for the null initializer, and dc_retain(null) is a
# DEFINED no-op (ADR-0049), so the instruction is now deleted outright.
#
# CHANGED AGAIN, retain 1 -> 0 / release 4 -> 3, BY ADR-0072 (escalation
# 0011 Option C), and the justification is owed in full because the old pin
# was ADR-0063's own worked example of a deliberate refusal. The refused
# pair was the `keep = node` reassignment retain, invalidated by the
# reassignment's release of the PREVIOUS keep sitting inside it -- refused
# because "the pass cannot tell the two objects apart". It now CAN, for
# exactly this shape and no wider: `node` is defined by `Alloc` in the same
# block and has not been referenced in any way that could create a second
# reference when the foreign release runs, so no release of any OTHER
# value can denote its object (nothing else names it), and no destructor
# cascade can reach it (no heap field holds it). The pending retain is
# spared (`--why`: freshSpared=1) and cancels against the per-iteration
# release. This is the Alloc base case of ADR-0072's returns-fresh
# machinery -- the very narrowing ADR-0063 measured and rejected AS A
# STANDALONE aliasing argument ("recovers lastKept and neither of the
# other two"); it returns as the intraprocedural base case of the derived
# summary escalation 0011 asked for, with the summary's own tests behind
# it. The pair that must NEVER cancel this way stays pinned in
# tests/conformance/fresh-return/ (nonFreshShape, retain=1) and in
# elide-alias's aliasBug (a Load-defined value is never fresh).
