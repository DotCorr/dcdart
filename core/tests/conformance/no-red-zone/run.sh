#
# Mechanical check of ADR-0039: a FREESTANDING object file must never use the
# x86-64 red zone.
#
# WHY THIS HARNESS IS SHAPED DIFFERENTLY FROM THE OTHERS
#
# Every other conformance target builds one example and asserts its behaviour.
# This one asserts a property of the EMITTED CODE across every example we
# have, because the bug it guards against is invisible to behavioural testing:
#
#   The red zone is 128 bytes below RSP that a leaf function may use without
#   adjusting the stack. Interrupts push their frame at RSP and land straight
#   on top of it. In an ordinary hosted process that never happens, so a
#   red-zone-using @bare object passes every behavioural test we own while
#   being silently fatal in a kernel the moment interrupts are enabled.
#
# So a green suite provably cannot catch this (docs/known-gaps.md GAP-0027)
# and the check has to look at instructions, not results.
#
# HONEST LIMIT OF THIS HARNESS, stated up front so nobody over-reads a pass:
# `dcc` currently invokes clang with no -O flag, and at -O0 clang does not use
# the red zone anyway. So this harness passes today BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT
# ADR-0039's fix — it does not, right now, demonstrate that the fix does
# anything. It is a FORWARD REGRESSION GUARD: the moment optimization is
# enabled, or a codegen change makes a leaf function spill, the red zone
# becomes reachable, and this is the check that catches it before a kernel
# does. The detector itself IS verified to work: run against a deliberately
# red-zone-using object it reports FAIL, and against the same object compiled
# with `noredzone` it reports pass (negative and positive control, done by
# hand when this was written).
#
# What DOES demonstrate the fix today is that the emitted IR carries the
# `noredzone` attribute and clang is invoked with `-mno-red-zone` for
# freestanding targets, both checked in step 2 below.
#
# The check itself: disassemble and look for any access at a NEGATIVE offset
# from %rsp. On x86-64, `-0x8(%rsp)` and friends are by definition below the
# stack pointer, which is the red zone and nowhere else. Accesses relative to
# %rbp are fine ONLY when the frame was actually allocated, so this also
# verifies that a frame-pointer-relative negative access is backed by a real
# `sub %rsp` in the same function.
#
# Usage:
#   bash core/tests/conformance/no-red-zone/run.sh
#
# Exit status: 0 on PASS, 1 on FAIL, 2 on harness usage/setup error.
