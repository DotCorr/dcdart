#!/usr/bin/env bash
# core/tests/conformance/rodata/run.sh
#
# Conformance target for static read-only data (ADR-0040).
#
# Two halves, and the second is the unusual one:
#
#   BEHAVIOUR -- build for the host, link against real libc, run, and check
#   every value. Standard.
#
#   LAYOUT -- disassemble the FREESTANDING object and assert the emitted
#   bytes directly. This exists because the consumer reads these tables
#   through a raw `Pointer<T>` at a hand-written stride. If a length word or
#   class pointer were ever emitted in front of element 0, every index would
#   silently shift and return plausible garbage rather than fail. The kernel
#   asked for these to be assertions rather than documentation, and it was
#   right to: `mb-info` already had to carry alignment guards because an
#   assumption of exactly this class went unstated once.
#
# Layout is checked on bare-x86_64 SPECIFICALLY, not on the host. Section
# placement is target-dependent and measurably so: the same pointer-bearing
# constant lands in `.rodata` on bare targets, `.data.rel.ro` on Linux (PIE
# by default), a `__TEXT,__const`/`__DATA,__const` split on macOS, and a
# single `.rdata` on Windows. Bare metal is what oscortex_core ships, so bare
# metal is what gets asserted.
#
# Usage:
#   bash core/tests/conformance/rodata/run.sh
#
# Exit status: 0 on PASS, 1 on FAIL, 2 on harness usage/setup error.
