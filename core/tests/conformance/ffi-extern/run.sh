#
# Mechanical check of docs/decisions/0038-extern-symbols-and-linking.md: the
# INBOUND half of DCDART_SPEC.md §9 -- DCDart calling a C-ABI symbol that is
# not defined in its own compilation unit, and linking several object files
# together.
#
# Six steps, each proving something the others cannot:
#
#   1. dcc emits an object with REAL undefined symbols and a manifest naming
#      exactly them.
#   2. verify-freestanding.sh PASSES that object, and says which externs it
#      honored (CLAUDE.md rule 1 is still mechanical, not waived).
#   3. THE SPINE TEST. With the manifest removed, the same object must FAIL
#      the same check. An undeclared undefined symbol is still fatal; that is
#      the whole difference between "rule 1 with a declared exception" and
#      "rule 1 abandoned". See docs/escalations/0003-extern-c-calls-vs-
#      freestanding.md, RATIFIED by the project owner (option 2), 2026-08-20.
#   4. FREESTANDING multi-object link (`-nostdlib`, no libc): the DCDart
#      object plus a companion C object plus an entry stub really link, and
#      the linked image has zero undefined symbols left. Run for real when
#      the host can execute x86-64 Linux binaries; link-verified otherwise
#      (m2-port's precedent for a target the host cannot execute).
#   5. NATIVE HOST link and REAL RUN of the same DCDart source: three objects
#      linked with plain clang, executed, exit code checked. This is the leg
#      that actually runs the extern calls on every supported host.
#   6. REAL LIBC: a second DCDart source calling ffs/toupper/putchar --
#      symbols nobody in this project wrote. Exit code AND the bytes putchar
#      left on stdout are both checked, so a constant-folded return value
#      cannot pass.
#
# Usage:
#   bash core/tests/conformance/ffi-extern/run.sh
#
# Exit status: 0 on PASS, 1 on FAIL, 2 on harness usage/setup error.
