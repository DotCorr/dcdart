// shapes verified empirically in docs/decisions/0008-m0-frontend-strategy.md
// (M0: `@bare u64 add(u64,u64) => a + b;`), 0010-pointer-load-store.md (M1:
// `Pointer<u32>.fromAddress`/`.value`), 0011-packed-struct-layout.md (M1:
// `@packed class ... extends Struct`), and 0014-result-value-representation.md
// (M1: `Result`/`.propagate()`, `if`). Everything is matched by exact Kernel
// IR node shape AND by the prelude library's URI, so an unrelated
// user-defined type/member elsewhere can never be misread as DCDart syntax.
//
// SCOPE CUT, on purpose (same discipline as core/dc-ir/instructions.dart):
// exactly the statement/expression shapes below and nothing else. Extend
// this file when a real conformance target needs more, not speculatively.
// Anything unrecognized throws DccLowerError naming the exact node type it

// `if`/`Result`/`.propagate()` (ADR-0014): fully implemented and verified
// end to end under WSL/Ubuntu (docs/known-gaps.md GAP-0007, resolved).
//
// M2 (ADR-0015/0016): `Alloc`/`Retain`/`Release` for real heap-allocated
// `HeapObject` subclasses -- real stored fields (not the getter-pair
// pattern below), real constructors, naive (non-elided) release-on-scope-
// exit. See docs/decisions/0016-heap-object-field-access.md.
//
// Struct field access (the OLDER, ADR-0011 pattern, unrelated to
// HeapObject/Alloc above) reuses ConstInt/IAdd/IntToPtr/Load/Store instead
// of a struct-specific instruction: a `@packed` struct "instance" is
// represented in DC-IR as nothing more than its base address (a plain
// DCInt.u64 value); `h.a` lowers to "address + offset -> pointer -> load".
// HeapObject fields use the newer PtrOffset instruction instead (ADR-0016)
// since their base is a DCHeapPointer, not a raw address.

  ///     iteration 65, not a slow leak. Refusing was the right call over
  ///     shipping that.
  ///
  ///     What the refusal was protecting is now provided rather than
  ///     removed: a body-scoped heap/weak local is released on EVERY path
  ///     that leaves the body — the normal fall-through into the back edge,
  ///     every `continue`, every `break` (including a labelled one out of a
  ///     nested loop, which unwinds both bodies), and every `return`
  ///     (already covered, since `_lowerReturn` releases the whole tracking
  ///     stack). The scope mark is `_heapLocals`/`_weakLocals`'s length at
  ///     body entry; `_releaseScopeFrom` emits the releases on a path and
  ///     `_forgetLocalsFrom` drops the tracking once every path is lowered.
  ///
  ///     The invariant this has to hold, and the one the old refusal
  ///     doubted: releases equal allocations per iteration. A loop of N
  ///     iterations allocating one object must show N releases at runtime
  ///     and equal `alloc`/`release` counts under `dc-objdump --arc`, which
  ///     `tests/conformance/loopheap` asserts both of.

  // Three operations, and the middle one is the whole design:
  //   1. TEAR OFF  -- `FuncRef`, turning a named function into a value whose
  //                   `DCFuncPtr` type records its ARC convention EXACTLY,
  //                   because the declaration is right there.
  //   2. CARRY     -- ordinary DCType equality, so the convention travels
  //                   with the value through locals, parameters and returns
  //                   and cannot be lost or silently widened.
  //   3. CALL      -- `IndirectCall`, which reads ownership back off the
  //                   pointer's type instead of being told it.
  //
  // Step 2 is why an indirect call is not an elision barrier here. See
  // docs/escalations/0008 §3 for what the alternative costs.
