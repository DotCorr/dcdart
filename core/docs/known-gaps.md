## GAP-0070 — float kernels were ~9x C because every element ADDRESS was computed with trapping u64 arithmetic through per-element inttoptr; volatile was blamed and measured innocent

**Domain:** dcc-lower, prelude (`Pointer<T>` addressing idiom), spec §4.1/§6 boundary (M3/M4, NEON N2)
**Status:** RESOLVED for this repo (2026-08-27, ADR-0070 `elementAt`/`PtrIndex`) — filed by the
unit that closed GAP-0034 (ADR-0069) when the split measurably did NOT move the ratio, and
resolved by the same unit after the real culprit was isolated. Kept verbose because the
misattribution → differential → fix chain is the useful part. **Follow-ups that stay open:**
`neon/native/*.dart` kernels still use the old idiom and should migrate to `elementAt` for the
same win (NEON's call, their oracle discipline); bounds policy for `elementAt` is GAP-0051's
still-open question; FMA is GAP-0068.

**RESOLUTION MEASUREMENT (harness, this host, 2026-08-27), after migrating matmul-f32 and
attention-f32 to `elementAt` — addressing only, FP order untouched, checksums bit-identical to
the unmodified C baselines:**

```
                before split   after split    after elementAt   vs trap-matched C
matmul-f32      9.280x ±0.3%   9.186x ±0.5%   1.110x ±0.3%      0.997x
attention-f32   3.586x ±0.5%   3.631x ±0.4%   1.056x ±0.3%      0.999x
```

Smoking-gun pair: the compiled matmul kernel had ZERO SIMD instructions before, and 32 `fmul.4s`
+ 32 `fadd.4s` + 48 vector-register load/stores after (host aarch64); on x86-64 the conformance
target `tests/conformance/elementat/` pins packed `mulps`/`addps` in saxpy's body at -O2. The
float kernels now sit AT PARITY with trap-matched C; the remaining ~6–11% vs plain C is the
separately-priced trap semantics of the VALUE arithmetic (the harness's traps column), which is
the M3 gate's own baseline question (ADR-0059), not an addressing cost.

**What the measurement says.** After ADR-0069 removed volatile from every ordinary `Pointer<T>`
access, the float ratios did not move: matmul-f32 9.280x → 9.186x, attention-f32 3.586x → 3.631x
vs plain C (harness, this host, same day). GAP-0034's "8.308x residual = volatile" attribution
was wrong.

**Where the cost actually is.** DCDart has no `elementAt` (GAP-0051), so every indexed access is
spelled `Pointer<f32>.fromAddress(base + (i * n + j) * u64(4)).value` — and every one of those
`+`/`*` is USER-LEVEL u64 arithmetic under spec §4.1's trap-by-default rule. The emitted inner
loop carries 5–6 `@llvm.uadd/umul.with.overflow.i64` + branch-to-`@llvm.trap` chains and a fresh
`inttoptr` PER ELEMENT. LLVM can neither vectorize a loop with that much side-exit control flow
nor prove the u64 sums non-overflowing (the base address is arbitrary), so nothing folds into
SCEV-addressable form. C never pays this: `a[i*n+k]` traps (in the trap-matched baseline) only on
the small INDEX arithmetic, which the compiler can bound and vectorize; C's base+offset scaling
is pointer arithmetic, untrapped by both C semantics and the baseline, so trap-matched C is
1.11x while trap-laden DCDart is 9.2x. The baselines are matched on VALUE arithmetic, not on
ADDRESS arithmetic, and address arithmetic is where the loop's instruction count lives.

**Decomposition, measured (matmul-f32, arg 400, Darwin/arm64 host, -O2):**

```
as emitted (traps + inttoptr, non-volatile)   540 ms     9.2x plain C
overflow traps stripped from the IR           142 ms     2.42x   <- traps are 3.8x of the gap
plain C                                        58.7 ms   1.0x
```

(Strip method: rewrite every `*.with.overflow` + extract + branch triple to a plain `add`/`mul`
+ unconditional branch; checksum identical, 288161451.) The post-trap 2.42x is still-scalar
codegen — inttoptr-per-element addressing the vectorizer does not recognize as a strided walk,
plus unfused mul/add (GAP-0068).

**The shape of the fix, built in the same unit once the coordinator confirmed the decomposition
independently** (ADR-0070): `Pointer<T>.elementAt(n)` (GAP-0051's ask, spec §6's own listed
primitive), lowered to a new DC-IR `PtrIndex` emitting one `getelementptr` — COMPILER-emitted,
provenance-preserving, non-trapping address scaling, so the trap-by-default rule keeps governing
what the PROGRAMMER writes while the compiler's own address math has the same standing as C's.
That one change attacked both halves exactly as the decomposition predicted: the 3.8x (no
user-level overflow checks in the address path; the loop counter's own trap check folds away
against the `i < n` guard) and the 2.42x (GEP addressing is what the vectorizer and SCEV
understand — the kernels now vectorize, see the resolution measurement above). What ADR-0070
deliberately did NOT decide: bounds policy (trap? inherit an allocation length?), which remains
GAP-0051's §4.1-adjacent open question, to be ADR'd before rule 4 freezes it.

## GAP-0069 — `oscortex_core`'s MMIO is still spelled `Pointer<T>`, which ADR-0069 made ordinary: its next rebuild is unsafe-under-optimization until it migrates to `Volatile<T>`

**Domain:** downstream (`oscortex_core`), prelude (M2 consumer)
**Status:** OPEN — blocking for the kernel's next rebuild against this tree, zero cost inside
this repo

ADR-0069 split device memory (`Volatile<T>`, volatile access) from ordinary memory
(`Pointer<T>`, plain access). Everything in THIS repo was reclassified in the same unit. The
kernel was not: `oscortex_core` reaches UART/PIC/PIT/IDT/VGA/framebuffer registers through
`Pointer<T>.value` across ~20 files, and those accesses now compile to plain loads/stores that
-O2 may elide or reorder — the exact defect class ADR-0041 measured (a deleted MMIO read-back
with every value check green, GAP-0006). Port I/O (`Port.outb/inb`) is unaffected, which covers
some but not all of the kernel's device traffic.

This was a KNOWN, accepted cost of the split: GAP-0034 recorded the kernel side saying it would
happily annotate ("it already knows exactly which of its pointers are device memory"), and
ADR-0069 spends ADR-0041's "no downstream source changes" property deliberately. But accepted is
not done:

- **Until migrated, do not ship a rebuilt kernel from this tree.** A kernel built before
  ADR-0069 is unaffected (its objects already exist); the hazard is the next `dcc build`.
- The migration is mechanical and greppable: every `Pointer<` whose address is a device register
  becomes `Volatile<`; every ordinary-RAM use (ELF parsing, FAT buffers, multiboot tables, heap
  structures) stays `Pointer<` and gets faster. The classification knowledge is the kernel
  team's, which is why this entry exists instead of a cross-repo edit by the unit that made the
  split.
- The proof pattern is ready to copy: `tests/conformance/volatile/` (IR grep + per-site objdump
  counts + automated negative control) and `tests/conformance/m1-pointer/` step 2b show how to
  pin each migrated register access.

**Cost of the workaround:** none in this repo; in the kernel, one grep-guided pass plus its
review. The failure mode if skipped is the worst kind: no crash, no wrong value in tests, a
device access that silently never happens under -O2.

## GAP-0067 — the pairs ADR-0066 deliberately left: mutating callees, and loops

**Domain:** dc-elide (M3 gate)
**Status:** OPEN — each surviving pair named with the limiter that holds it and why the refusal is
the correct call today

ADR-0066 cut the tree's surviving retains 106 → 42. What remains is not one wall but two, and
neither is a tuning knob:

**1. Descent pairs over a mutating callee (hashmap: 10 of its 13 surviving retains, and the
dominant surviving *dynamic* cost — ~10 executed pairs per insert and per remove).**
`tinsert`/`tremove`/`unlinkFrom`/`unlinkHead` fail rule T's covered-release check because they
GENUINELY decrement objects they never retained: `e.next = n.head` and `p.next = c.next` each emit
`Store new; Release old`, and the released old value is exactly the aliasing-release shape GAP-0054
was a use-after-free through. So every recursive descent call into them stays opaque, and the
per-level `final c = n.c0; if (c != null) return tinsert(c, ...)` pair survives. **This refusal is
load-bearing, not conservative slack**: a summary that waved these through would be wrong the first
time a caller held a pending retain on anything reachable from the mutated chain. What would
recover them, in order of plausibility: (a) escalation 0011's return-value uniqueness plus
field-type reasoning (the released `old` is an `Entry`, the pending retain a `Trie` — a fact the
untyped `HeapRef<void>` IR cannot currently see); (b) a "releases only values loaded from its OWN
parameters' fields" refinement — measured to be unsound as stated, since the pending object IS
reachable from the callee's parameter; do not reach for it without a new argument.

**Update (2026-08-27, ADR-0072 — escalation 0011's Option C landed; each of the 13 checked
individually against the new returns-fresh fact, per the assignment): NONE recover, and this
item's attribution gets one correction.** Full per-site table in ADR-0072; the shape of the
answer: (i) four of the 13 (`tinsert`'s `e.next = n.head` and `n.head = e` store-retains,
`unlinkFrom`/`unlinkHead`'s `parent.head = c.next`) are **store-retains with NO matching release
in their function** — ownership lands in a heap field, so no pending-pair rule of any strength
can elide them; their recovery is route (a)'s must-alias half (`Retain new-field-value` /
`Release re-load-of-the-untouched-source-field` is a MOVE between fields), not freshness, and the
releaseLimited counter they show under `--why` was misleading about the real wall. (ii) Six are
descent pairs whose retained value is a `Load` — never fresh — held by the opaque recursive call
exactly as written above; rule T's refusal stays load-bearing. (iii) `mapInsert`'s three retain a
genuinely-fresh `Alloc` that loses freshness by ESCAPING into the new Entry, which is then passed
to the non-transparent `tinsert` — the opaque-call rule fires, correctly (a callee holding the
cluster could release into it). So this item's residue waits on (a)-style callee-release /
must-alias reasoning, exactly as written; the freshness fact was necessary groundwork and is not
sufficient here.

**2. Loops (rule F refuses any back edge). RESOLVED (2026-08-27) — ADR-0068 §1**, in exactly the
predicted shape: the retain's block and every frontier block must lie on no CFG cycle, interior
loop bodies are walked and must scan clean (no ARC op, no opaque op — enforced by the walk itself,
no separate region rule needed), dominators moved to the iterative fixpoint. `loaderNextBatch` —
this item's named acceptance test — now cancels (`crossBlock=1`, retain 0 in the emitted library),
and NEON's build stays fully green, epoch heap-clean. What ADR-0068 still refuses, on purpose: the
retain-and-release-both-inside-one-iteration shape (needs an alternation argument nobody has made;
no measured case wants it — `parseArray`'s in-loop `Retain tail` is independently blocked by an
aliasing field-store release in its interval).

Also left, already tracked elsewhere: the releaseLimited pairs GAP-0066 still holds after
ADR-0068's run-atomic matching (non-adjacent shapes: ~~`lastKept`~~ — recovered 2026-08-27 by
ADR-0072's freshness rule — `parseArray`'s two field-store pairs (also loop-carried, see item 2's
leftover shape), `tensorSlice0`); `mapInsert`'s three value-store retains (opaque over `tinsert`,
same as item 1).

**Cost of the workaround:** hashmap's residual keeps ~20 executed pairs per round (insert+remove
descents) of the ~30 it had; lookup's ~12 are gone. Item 1 is now the whole hashmap story: all 13
of its surviving retains are held by it or by its `mapInsert` corollary. Measured after ADR-0068
(nonatomic, medians): hashmap 2.20× vs trap-matched C (byte-identical object, ambient drift only),
tree-traversal 2.16×, json 0.57× — 3-bench geomean ~1.40× against the ≤1.10× bar. It does not
reach 1.10× from elision alone until item 1 or GAP-0066's remainder moves.

## GAP-0061 — DCDart cannot express an ARRAY of ARC-managed references, so O(1) indexed access to managed objects is inexpressible

**Domain:** dcc-lower, spec §3 / §6 (M3). **Status:** OPEN — escalated (`docs/escalations/0010`),
because the honest fix is a language change rather than a lowering

Found writing M3's `hashmap` benchmark (ADR-0061, `dc-sys-21`'s work, integrated 2026-08-27).
GAP-0035 and `bench/README.md` both listed `hashmap` as *writable*, unblocked by ADR-0054's generic
classes plus ADR-0058's heap, with the remaining work described as "writing a `Map<K,V>` and a
workload over it". **A hash map is writable. A hash map with a bucket ARRAY is not**, and that is
not a detail of the data structure — it is the one operation a hash map is named for.

Three routes exist to indexed storage and none of them can hold a managed reference:

| route | why not |
|---|---|
| a field of a `HeapObject` | the only place a managed reference may live, and there is no array-typed field. `u64 a0; u64 a1; …` is the workaround, and it does not scale to a bucket table |
| `Heap.allocate` raw bytes + `Pointer<T>` | raw memory. A store through it emits no `Retain` and a free emits no `Release`, so the reference is invisible to ARC — the object leaks or is freed under a live alias |
| an address, kept in raw storage, converted back on read | **there is no conversion.** `Pointer<T>.fromAddress` exists and nothing turns an address into a managed reference. Every design that tries to keep ownership "somewhere else" and index by address dead-ends here |

**Cost of the workaround, measured rather than estimated.** `hashmap` indexes its 1024 buckets with a
**complete binary trie of depth 10**, and `kernel.c` walks the same trie so that neither side chases
more pointers than the other. `bench/benchmarks/hashmap/index-tax/` runs the identical workload in C
with a real bucket array — same keys, same values, same order, same checksum — and the trie costs the
**C baseline 1.34×** (ADR-0061 §5).

The DCDart side pays considerably more than 1.34×, and this is the part that matters for the gate:
**reading a heap-typed field into a local is an alias retain (ADR-0017) with a matching release**, so
each of the ten descent levels is a retain/release pair, none of which pass 3 elides — GAP-0062
measured that independently (every pair straddles a block boundary at a null test). An array-indexed
map would execute roughly 1–2 such pairs per operation; the trie executes ~10. `hashmap`'s ratio
against trap-matched C is therefore **inflated by a missing language feature, not only by ARC**, and
ADR-0061 §5 says so next to the number rather than in a footnote.

Recursion does not avoid it and neither does a loop: a `HeapObject` parameter is borrowed (ADR-0019),
so the recursive descent's *calls* are free, but the *field read* is the retain either way, and a loop
reassigning a heap-typed local (ADR-0048) costs a pair per level as well.

**What this does NOT block.** Trees, lists, chains and anything else navigated by named fields are
fine and always were — `tree-traversal` needs nothing here. What it blocks is every structure whose
defining property is indexed access: a hash table, a dynamic array, a ring buffer of objects, a page
table of managed pages.

## GAP-0054 — ADR-0025 can elide a retain/release pair across a `Release` of an ALIASING value

**Domain:** dc-elide (M2). **Pre-existing — not introduced by ADR-0054, but found by it.**
**Status:** **RESOLVED (2026-08-26) — ADR-0063.** A surviving `Release` now invalidates every pending
retain, not only a matching one. A `Release` the pass *deletes* invalidates nothing, because it never
executes. Pass 3's safety argument is now local to the pass.

**It was reachable, and it was live.** The entry below correctly declined to call it a bug and
correctly named the shape that would reach it. That shape got written:
`examples/m3-elide-alias/elide_alias.dart`, using only ADR-0048's mid-function heap-field release,
returned **198 where 110 is correct** through `dcc build` at `-O2` — a read of freed memory whose
slot had already been recycled.

**It was invisible to every check this project ran.** Cancelling a pair is refcount-NEUTRAL, so
`dc_heap_live` read zero on every call and every count balanced. No leak test could see it, and
there was no double free to trap on. Only asserting the VALUE caught it, which is why
`tests/conformance/elide-alias/` exists.

**What it cost to fix:** exactly three pre-existing pairs stop being elided — `json`'s `parseArray`,
`m2-loopheap`'s `lastKept`, `m3-generic-class`'s `boxNode` — for a measured **~4% on the `json`
benchmark**. That is not zero, it is attributed per target in ADR-0063, and the recovery is
GAP-0066 / escalation 0011.

The original entry follows unchanged, because its reasoning was right.

---


Spec §3.2 pass 3, as implemented, deletes `retain(x) … release(x)` when **no release of x** appears
between them. It reasons over DCValues. Two DCValues can refer to the same runtime object — that is
the entire premise of ADR-0017's alias retain — so "no release of `x`" is not the same statement as
"nothing released this object".

Found while deriving `boxNode`'s expected ARC counts for `tests/conformance/generic-class/`. There,
the elided pair sits across `Release n` and `Release b`, and `Release b` runs `Box$Node_dtor`, which
releases the very object the elided retain was protecting. It is **safe there**, and the reason is
worth stating precisely: the last *use* of the value (`got.n`) is lowered before any of the releases,
because `_releaseHeapLocals` only runs at return, after the return expression. So there is no use
after the premature free, because there is no use at all.

That is a property of how `dcc-lower` orders a return, not of the elision pass. The shape that breaks
it already exists in the language: a heap-field store (ADR-0048) emits a `Release` of the old value
**mid-function**. `final got = b.unwrap(); a.next = other; return got.n;` would put a release of a
potentially-aliasing object between the retain and the use, with the pass still deleting the pair
because it never sees a release of `got` itself.

**Cost of the workaround:** none paid, because nothing was worked around — this is a recorded finding,
not a repair. The cost is that the safety argument for pass 3 currently depends on an invariant that
lives in a different file from the pass and is not asserted anywhere. Generic containers make the
shape much easier to reach: `map.get(k)` returning a borrowed reference, followed by a mutation of the
map, is the canonical form and it is exactly what M3's hashmap benchmark will write. Worth settling
before that benchmark, not after — and the honest fix is probably for pass 3 to invalidate pending
retains on ANY `Release`, not only a matching one, which costs some elision and is measurable.

## GAP-0065 — a freshly-allocated temporary passed to a BORROWED parameter is never released

**Domain:** dcc-lower (ARC insertion, ADR-0021). **Pre-existing — found while writing ADR-0063's
example, not caused by it.**
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-09-13) — temporary-ownership conformance checks direct, local, indirect, and method borrowed calls, including weak temporaries.
nothing to do with pass 3

```dart
final c = Cell(Node(v));            // leaks one Node per call
final n = Node(v); final c = Cell(n);  // correct — balanced
```

`Cell(this.next)`'s parameter is borrowed by default (ADR-0019), so the constructor emits a `Retain`
to store it into the field. The temporary `Node(v)` therefore carries a `+1` from its own `Alloc`
that **nothing ever releases**: there is no local to hang a release on, and the argument was not
`@owned`, so no transfer happened either. `dc_heap_live` climbs by exactly one per call.

Same family as GAP-0060 (a `void` body falling off the end never releasing its `@owned` heap
parameters): in both, a release has no syntactic site to be emitted at. Both should be looked at with
GAP-0050's per-iteration release policy — the real fix is emitting releases at every function EXIT
and for every temporary, rather than at every `Return` and for every named local.

**Cost of the workaround:** bind the temporary to a local. `examples/m3-elide-alias`'s
`releaseThroughDestructor` does, with a comment saying why, so that target's leak assertion measures
elision rather than this. Any expression that nests a constructor call inside another constructor
call leaks today, silently, one object per call — and unlike GAP-0054 this one IS visible to a leak
test, which is the only reason it is a gap rather than a second miscompilation.

---

## GAP-0066 — pass 3 cannot tell two heap values apart, so it surrenders every pair spanning a release

**Domain:** dc-elide, spec §3 (M3 gate)
**Status:** OPEN — the price of ADR-0063, measured and attributed

ADR-0063 stopped a use-after-free by making any surviving `Release` invalidate every pending retain.
That is correct and it is blunt: the pass has no way to prove two `DCHeapPointer` values denote
different objects, so it assumes they may.

Per target, `bench/elision-delta.sh`, before → after (retains lowered → surviving):

| target | before | after | pairs lost |
|---|---|---|---|
| `json` | 19 → 18 | 19 → 19 | **1** |
| `m2-loopheap` | 2 → 1 | 2 → 2 | **1** |
| `m3-generic-class` | 2 → 1 | 2 → 2 | **1** |
| `tree-traversal`, `m2-list`, `m2-closure`, `m2-owned`, `m2-heap-field`, `m2-alias`, `m3-funcptr` | — | unchanged | 0 |

Runtime: **~4% on `json`** (two interleaved A/B runs, 600 samples a side: +4.5%, +4.2%). Every other
benchmark's object file is byte-identical.

**The narrowing that does not work.** A pending retain on a value defined by `Alloc` in this block
that has not escaped cannot be the object another value releases. That recovers `lastKept` and
**neither of the other two**, because both retain a `Load` or `Call` result. It buys back none of the
4%, for a second aliasing argument in a pass where a wrong one is a double free. Deliberately not
taken; reach for it only if a workload appears that it *would* recover.

**The one that would work** is knowing a returned reference is a fresh `+1` nothing else aliases —
which DCDart's ARC conventions do not express. That is spec §3 under rule 4: **escalation 0011**.

**Cost of the workaround:** ~4% on one M3 benchmark, and it grows with any workload built on
"container method returns a node", which is most of a stdlib. Independent of GAP-0062's intra-block
limit — the two have different causes and different fixes, and attempting them together makes a
regression in either direction unattributable when one of them is a use-after-free.

**Update (2026-08-27, ADR-0066):** unchanged in substance — the surviving-release rule is exactly
as blunt as before and every ADR-0063 refusal still holds (`m3-elide-alias` 7 → 3 byte-for-byte;
`boxNode`'s dangerous pair still `releaseLimited`). Two notes. (1) One of the three pairs ADR-0063's
table lists as lost, `boxNode`'s OTHER pair, is recovered by rule T (its interval spans only the
release-free `unwrap` call, no surviving release) — the count reads 2 → 1 now, and the 1 is this
gap's pair. (2) A second live instance: NEON `tensor.dart`'s `epochReduce` — `Retain t;
tensorDestroy(t) @owned; Release s2; Release s1; Release t`. The consumed pair would cancel under
ADR-0031, but the two slice releases sit between the call and `Release t`, and each is a surviving
release of a value nothing proves distinct. Fixes, still in preference order: escalation 0011
(return-value uniqueness — `tensorSlice0`'s results are fresh `+1`s, the convention just cannot say
so), or a `_releaseHeapLocals` emission-order study in dcc-lower (releasing `t` FIRST would let the
pair cancel with no analysis at all) — the latter is a lowering-policy change, not an elide change,
and belongs with GAP-0050's release-placement work.

**Update (2026-08-27, ADR-0068):** the emission-order study named above was run, and NARROWED this
gap rather than closing it. The study's own finding: no static release order dominates
(most-recently-used-first recovered `epochReduce` and un-elided `m2-heap-field`; the tried lowering
change was reverted byte-identical), so the order-dependence was removed in the pass instead —
run-atomic matching over maximal runs of literally ADJACENT releases, safety argued in ADR-0068 §2.
Recovered by it: `parseArray`'s tail-append pair (this gap's headline case and its measured ~4% —
json's kernel moved 25.4 → 24.0 ms, −5.5%, the only benchmark whose object changed),
`epochReduce`'s consumed pair (note (2) above, resolved), `boxNode`'s `got` pair, and
`releaseThroughDestructor` — each with the last use provably before the adjacent run. STILL HELD by
this gap, because their surviving release is NOT adjacent to the pair's (a real use or arithmetic
sits between): `aliasBug`/`aliasBugNullable` (the genuine UAF shapes — these must never cancel
without escalation 0011's fact), `lastKept`, `parseArray`'s two field-store pairs, `tensorSlice0`'s,
and every mutating-callee descent (GAP-0067 item 1). The blunt rule itself is untouched; escalation
0011 remains the only route to the remainder.

**Update (2026-08-27, ADR-0072): escalation 0011's fact now EXISTS — Option C, owner-decided,
derived returns-fresh — and this gap narrows once more, precisely.** Recovered: `lastKept`
(retain 2 → 0 on m2-loopheap; the pending retain is on an `Alloc`-fresh value, spared across the
reassignment's foreign release, `--why` freshSpared=1), plus the new pinned fixture
`tests/conformance/fresh-return/` (the escalation's straight-line shape, recovered through the
derived summary with a use between the releases so run-atomic provably is not what cancels it).
STILL HELD, now each with its terminal reason rather than "needs 0011": `aliasBug` /
`aliasBugNullable` — their retained values are `Load`-defined, and a Load is NEVER fresh; this is
the correct permanent answer, not slack, and `fresh-return/nonFreshShape` pins the equivalent
refusal for an escaped call result. `parseArray`'s two field-store pairs — loop-carried
cross-iteration pairs (the retain's block is on a CFG cycle), held by GAP-0067 item 2's leftover
alternation shape, which freshness does not address; notably the summary DOES prove
`parseValue`/`parseArray`/`parseString`/`parseNumber` returns-fresh, so only the loop shape
stands. `tensorSlice0`'s — same family, plus stores into a non-fresh holder. Mutating-callee
descents — GAP-0067 item 1, per-site outcomes there and in ADR-0072 (none recover; four of
hashmap's 13 turn out to be store-retains with no matching release, which NO pending-pair rule
can elide). The blunt rule remains for every value the derivation cannot prove fresh, which is

## GAP-0055 — Generic METHODS on classes are not implemented

**Domain:** dcc-lower (M3)
**Status:** OPEN — refused by name at the call site, not half-handled

ADR-0052 monomorphizes generic top-level functions; ADR-0054 monomorphizes generic classes. A generic
*method* — `R map<R>(R seed)` on `Box<T>` — is neither. It would need one body per (class
instantiation × method type arguments) pair, which is a product neither drain produces.

Before it was refused explicitly, it failed with ADR-0052's *"type parameter R has no binding … which
is a dcc-lower bug"* — both confusing and untrue: it is an unimplemented shape, not a broken
invariant. The call site now names it and says what to do instead.

**Cost of the workaround:** write it as a generic top-level function taking the receiver as its first
parameter, which is what the method lowers to anyway (ADR-0043). Ergonomically worse and exactly as
fast. The shape that will want this first is a container's `map`/`fold`, which M3's benchmarks may or
may not need depending on how the hashmap is written.

---

## GAP-0056 — A generic receiver's type arguments are recovered structurally, from a finite set of expression shapes

**Domain:** dcc-lower (M3)
**Status:** OPEN — a diagnostic, not a silent wrong answer

Kernel does not record a receiver's type arguments on the access node: `InstanceGet` and
`InstanceInvocation` carry an interface target whose enclosing class is the *template*. ADR-0054
recovers them by walking the receiver expression instead — `this`, a local (via its declared type), a
constructor call, a field read, a method result — and refuses anything else by name.

The obvious alternative, a `StaticTypeContext`, needs `CoreTypes`/`ClassHierarchy` over a component
compiled `--no-link-platform`, where `dart:core` is not linked at all (`kernel_frontend.dart`). It is
the same constraint that makes `_lowerSignatureType` inspect `.classNode` directly rather than ask a
type environment anything, so this is not a shortcut around an available API — the API is not
available.

**Cost of the workaround:** the set of receiver shapes is finite and will need extending as the
language grows; each extension is a new branch in `_receiverInstanceOrNull`. A shape it does not
understand is a compile error telling the author to bind the receiver to a typed local first, which
is a real ergonomic cost but never a wrong layout. If DCDart ever links the platform (or grows its
own type environment), this collapses into one call.

## GAP-0026 — No signed sized-integer types, so a C `int` parameter has to be declared `u32`

**Domain:** dcc-lower, runtime prelude (M1/M2, surfaced by ADR-0038's extern FFI)
**Status:** OPEN — ABI-correct today, interpretation-incorrect for negative values

`DCDART_SPEC.md` §4.1 `[LOAD-BEARING]` lists `i8 i16 i32 i64 isize` alongside the unsigned widths, and
`dc-ir/lib/types.dart`'s `DCInt` already carries a `signed` flag the backend honours (`IShr` picks
logical vs. arithmetic shift from it, ADR-0030). **The prelude implements only the unsigned half.**
There is no way to write a signed sized integer in DCDart source at all.

Harmless until ADR-0038, because nothing crossed an ABI boundary where the distinction was visible.
It is visible now: `core/examples/ffi-extern/libc_calls.dart` declares `int ffs(int)` as
`u32 ffs(u32)`. That is **ABI-correct** — `int` and `uint32_t` are the same 32-bit register operand on
both SysV-AMD64 and AAPCS64, differing only in interpretation — and every value the conformance target
uses is inside `0..2^31-1`, where the two interpretations agree. It would be **wrong** for a C
function that returns a negative value (`strcmp`, `read`'s `-1`, any `errno`-style API), which DCDart
would read as a huge unsigned number with no diagnostic anywhere.

**Cost of the workaround:** the extern surface is honest only for non-negative values, and the ADR and
the example both say so in a comment rather than leaving it as a trap. Any C API with a negative
sentinel is currently un-declarable correctly. Fixing it is prelude + `_lowerSignatureType` work, not
a backend change — `DCInt.signed` is already threaded through.


**2026-09-14 implementation update:** i8/i16/i32/i64 and signed division/remainder
are implemented in development with MIN/-1 and zero guards. See ADR-0077 and
`signed-int`. Native and both freestanding regressions are being verified; the
entry remains open until cross-platform C interoperability and all recorded
subrequirements are checked. This is not in published v0.1.3.

## GAP-0032 — `dcc` never passes an optimization flag, so every DCDart program ships `-O0` code

**Domain:** backend / dcc
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-08-21) — `dcc` compiles at `-O2` (ADR-0042). Landed only after ADR-0041
made `Pointer<T>` access volatile; doing it in the other order would have silently deleted MMIO
accesses while every test went green. M3's measurement is now meaningful, and should be read with
GAP-0034 in mind.

`backend/lib/compile.dart` invokes `clang` with `-ffreestanding -fno-builtin -fno-stack-protector
-fno-exceptions -fno-unwind-tables -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -c`. There is no `-O` anywhere, so
LLVM runs at `-O0`: no register allocation to speak of, no constant folding, no strength reduction, no
CSE, no unrolling.

Measured on a non-allocating loop (`sum ^= *(u32*)(base + i*4)` over `count` elements), all three
compiled for `x86_64-unknown-none-elf`:

| build | instructions | shape |
|---|---|---|
| DCDart as `dcc` ships it | 54 | every local spilled to stack; `mulq` for `i*4`; constant 0 materialized as `xor`+`add` |
| **the same DCDart IR at `-O2`** | **21** | values in registers; `xorl (%r9), %eax` direct memory operand; tight 8-instruction loop |
| C at `-O2` | 36 | longer only because it unrolled 4x |

**Why this entry matters more than its size, stated as sharply as it deserves.** M3 is the project's
hard gate — geometric mean ARC overhead ≤10% vs C — and `ROADMAP.md` says nothing downstream starts
until it is green. A benchmark run today would attribute the ENTIRE `-O0` penalty to ARC. It would not
merely produce a pessimistic number: it would **fail the gate**, and failing it triggers exactly the
response the roadmap prescribes — *"fix the optimizer, or accept and document a higher number, or
revisit the model."* The third option means changing the memory model. **The project would consider
revisiting ARC to fix a missing compiler flag.**

That is why this is a prerequisite rather than an optimization: it is not that the number would be
wrong, it is that a wrong number here has a standing procedure attached to it that damages the
language.

Visible in shipped kernel code, not only in synthetic loops — `oscortex_core`'s `uartPutc`, verified
by the kernel side from a real build:

```
b85: movb %al, 0x1(%rsp)      <- store to a stack slot
b89: movb 0x1(%rsp), %al      <- reload it immediately; a no-op pair
b8d: xorl %ecx, %ecx
b8f: addb $0x20, %cl          <- the constant 0x20, built in two instructions
b94: xorl %ecx, %ecx
b96: addb $0x1, %cl
b99: cmpb %cl, %al            <- instead of `cmpb $1, %al`
```

plus `xorl %eax,%eax; movw %ax,%dx; addw $0x3fd,%dx` to materialize a port number that is one `movw`.
None of that is an ARC artefact or a memory-model cost.

It also corrects a wrong conclusion that is easy to reach from reading the output: DCDart's emitted
code looks nothing like C's, so it is tempting to infer that ARC or some runtime is responsible. It is
not — the same IR through `-O2` is the same class of code as C. Verified separately: non-allocating
programs emit **zero** ARC instructions (`m2-port`, `m1-pointer`, `m2-bitwise`, `demo-stats`,
`m2-rodata` all report `alloc=0 retain=0 release=0`), and a `@bare` object has zero undefined symbols,
so there is no runtime to call into.

**Cost of the workaround:** nothing depends on `-O0`, so it is not load-bearing anywhere. But it is not
a one-line change, and the reasons are the interesting part:

- It makes the red zone genuinely reachable for the first time. ADR-0039 already handles it, and
  `tests/conformance/no-red-zone/`'s codegen half converts from a forward guard into a LIVE check —
  that harness has never actually been exercised, because `-O0` does not use the red zone anyway.
- It is the change most likely to expose latent UB in emitted IR that `-O0` hides, and by GAP-0027 the
  conformance suite structurally cannot see the bare-metal-only classes of that.

So the acceptance criterion should include `oscortex_core`, which is DCDart's only real `@bare` test
(GAP-0027). Its three harnesses assert byte-exact serial output from real hardware behaviour — 256 IDT
gates, PIT ticks with EOI, a real `#UD` survived. If the captures still match byte-for-byte at `-O2`,
that is strong evidence. If they do not, `-O0` was hiding something real, which is worth more than a
clean run. The kernel side has offered to run exactly that.

## GAP-0040 — Generic CLASSES are not monomorphized, only generic functions

**Domain:** dcc-lower (M2/M3)
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-08-26) — ADR-0054. Both halves: per-instantiation layout AND the
recursion bound this entry said must land at the same time. See the resolution note at the end.

ADR-0052 monomorphizes generic FUNCTIONS. A generic class — `Box<T>`, and therefore every container
M3's hashmap benchmark would want — is not implemented.

The reason it is a separate unit rather than more of the same: a generic function's specialization
only needs its signature types resolved, and `_lowerType` does that in one place. A generic class
needs **per-instantiation field layout**, which means `_HeapLayouts` must key layouts by
(class, type arguments) rather than by class, and the destructor cascade (ADR-0022) must synthesize
one destructor per instantiation rather than one per class. Both are reachable; neither is a
one-line change, and both touch code the ARC targets depend on.

Also unguarded and worth knowing before that work starts: **recursion through a type parameter** —
`f<T>` calling `f<Box<T>>` — would queue specializations forever. It is unreachable today because
generic classes do not exist to build the infinite type with, so it is recorded rather than guarded
speculatively. Whoever adds generic classes must add a depth or set bound at the same time.

**Cost of the workaround:** a container is written concretely per element type, which is what C does
and what the kernel already does. Fine for a handful of types, and exactly the duplication generics
exist to remove.

**Resolution.** ADR-0054, `tests/conformance/generic-class/`. `_HeapLayouts` is keyed by a
`_ClassInstance` (class + type arguments) exactly as this entry predicted it would have to be, and a
non-generic class is the degenerate instantiation with an empty argument list — which is what let
every M2 symbol keep its name and body while flowing through the new path. The destructor cascade is
synthesized per instantiation, so `Box<u64>` gets **no** destructor and `Box<Node>` gets
`Box$Node_dtor`, from the same class.

The ARC half is the part worth reading before touching this code again, because this entry
under-stated it. It is not only that each instantiation needs *a* destructor; it is that `Box<u64>`
and `Box<Node>` have **identical payload sizes and opposite ARC obligations**. Getting it wrong in
one direction leaks an arena slot per construction; getting it wrong in the other releases a `u64` as
if it were a heap pointer. Only the second is invisible to a leak test, which is why the conformance
target asserts the *absence* of `Box$u64_dtor` in the symbol table rather than trusting the heap
baseline to catch it.

The unguarded recursion this entry flagged is guarded: a type-argument nesting bound and a total
instantiation bound, both compile errors naming what ran away, with
`examples/m3-generic-class/recursive_reject.dart` as a permanent negative fixture run under a
timeout — because for that program the only two possible behaviours are "reject" and "hang", and a
bound that is merely slow is not a bound.

Two pre-existing bugs fell out, neither in new code, both latent until a type argument could itself
be generic: ADR-0052's mangling dropped a type argument's own type arguments (`pick<Box<u64>>` and
`pick<Box<Node>>` collided on one symbol, and the queue deduplicates by symbol), and
`_lowerCalleeType` only substituted a bare `T`, so a callee signature saying `Box<T>` passed through
unbound. Both fixed in the same commit; see the ADR.

What this did NOT do: generic methods (GAP-0055), generic class hierarchies, and any measurement of
the code-size cost of monomorphization (escalation 0009).

## GAP-0039 — Mutable statics have no concurrency story

**Domain:** dc-ir, backend (M2, downstream: `oscortex_core`)
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-08-26) — ADR-0055 (atomics) and ADR-0056 (barriers). See the resolution
note at the end of this entry for what it did NOT cover, which is the more important half.

ADR-0051 gives DCDart mutable global storage. It gives no guarantee whatsoever about concurrent
access. A `@bss` counter incremented from an interrupt handler and read from ordinary code is a
read-modify-write with no atomicity: the classic lost-update, and nothing in the language says so.

This compounds GAP-0033 (no memory barriers) rather than duplicating it. Barriers are about ORDERING
between accesses; this is about ATOMICITY of a single one. A kernel needs both, and DCDart currently
offers neither.

**Cost of the workaround:** invisible on a single core where interrupt entry and exit serialize, which
is where `oscortex_core` is today — and that is exactly what makes it dangerous, because the code
that works now is the code that will be wrong later. It becomes real at the first SMP bring-up, and
the failure mode is a lost tick or a corrupted bitmap entry that reproduces once a week.

The eventual answer is atomic read-modify-write primitives, which interact with the same
device-memory-versus-ordinary-memory type distinction GAP-0034 needs. Worth solving together rather
than bolting `Atomic<T>` onto a language that cannot yet say which memory is which.

**Resolution.** `Atomic.load`/`store`/`exchange`/`fetchAdd`/`fetchSub`/`fetchAnd`/`fetchOr`/`fetchXor`
at `u8`…`u64` (ADR-0055), plus `fence(Ordering.…)` (ADR-0056) for the ordering half this entry
correctly said was a *different* question. The tick counter is `Atomic.fetchAdd`; the free-frame
bitmap is `fetchOr`/`fetchAnd`, which is worth repeating because this entry names "a corrupted bitmap
entry" and it is a different operation from the lost tick.

Every operation lowers to a real instruction — `lock xadd`, `lock cmpxchg`, `xchg` — never a
`__atomic_*` libcall, which would be a rule 1 violation. `tests/conformance/atomic/` asserts that by
name at every optimization level, and asserts a paired negative control: the same read-modify-write
written non-atomically must stay unlocked, without which the whole harness proves nothing.

**Not solved together with GAP-0034, contrary to this entry's own recommendation.** That advice was
about `Atomic<T>` as a wrapper TYPE, which is not what shipped: `Atomic.*` are static methods over a
`Pointer<T>` (a wrapper type needs generic classes, GAP-0040). The device/ordinary-memory distinction
turned out not to be a prerequisite of atomicity at all — but it IS a prerequisite of testing the
ordering half, which is GAP-0043.

**What this did NOT touch, and it is the larger hazard.** ARC's own refcounts are non-atomic:
`_emitRetain` is a plain `load i32`/`add`/`store i32`, emitted by the compiler on every ownership
transfer in every program without anyone asking. That is this entry's failure mode one layer down,
and it is a spec §3.1 question frozen at M3 rather than something to fix in a unit like this one.
Escalation 0007.

## GAP-0038 — Nullable source checks exist; foreign heap pointers remain unchecked

**Domain:** frontend, backend
**Status:** PARTIAL — source null safety verified; invalid foreign-pointer defense remains open

The 2026-09-14 regression disproved the earlier claim that discarding nullability in DC-IR
lets an unchecked nullable access compile. The Dart frontend rejects `Node? x; x.value`
before lowering and accepts a dereference following `if (x == null) return ...`.
`tests/conformance/null-safety` preserves both the refusal and native execution of the
checked path, including null passed to a nullable C ABI parameter.

This is not a guarantee for arbitrary C callers: a foreign caller can violate a non-null
heap parameter's contract, and field addressing still has no explicit runtime null trap.
Pointer validity and lifetime at that boundary remain the caller's responsibility. A
future defense must distinguish that boundary issue from source-level flow checking.

---

## GAP-0037 — Every "not supported yet" refusal in `dcc-lower` deserves re-examination; at least one was already safe

**Domain:** dcc-lower (process, not a single defect)
**Status:** OPEN — one instance found and fixed (ADR-0044), the rest unaudited

ADR-0028 refused to lower nested `while` loops, with a comment explaining that recursing would
"silently scope the carried-variable analysis to the wrong loop". It read as considered, and it was
wrong: `_lowerWhile` already filtered candidates to variables present in `_values`, which is exactly
the scoping guarantee the comment wanted. Enabling nesting was one line, and every hard case —
an inner loop assigning an outer variable, triple nesting, an early return out of both — worked
immediately.

It sat for eleven ADRs and was found by `oscortex_core` hitting it twice in one milestone, not by
this repo.

**The generalizable part.** A crash gets investigated. A deliberate, well-commented refusal naming a
plausible hazard reads as a decision someone already made, and is therefore *less* likely to be
re-examined — the comment does the work of discouraging the next person. That is an unusual failure
mode: the better the comment, the longer the wrong refusal survives.

`dcc-lower` contains several more of these — `break`/`continue`, heap locals in loop bodies,
getters/setters on `HeapObject` (ADR-0043), heap-typed field stores (escalation 0006). Some are
genuinely unresolved design questions; at least one was not. They have never been audited as a group.
Two have since been audited individually, and they came out opposite ways, which is the useful part:
`break`/`continue` (ADR-0047) was a refusal that had stopped being real, while heap locals in loop
bodies (2026-08-26, GAP-0050) was a refusal that WAS real and stayed real right up until the
guarantee behind it was actually built. "Audit the refusal" does not mean "delete the refusal".

**A SECOND question, added 2026-08-22.** The audit question below assumes the thing being audited is
a refusal. Two of ADR-0050's silent hangs had no refusal at all: the loop-carried walker was correct,
complete, and simply *not reached* — the update clause was never handed to it. So ask both:
**"is this refusal still real?"** AND **"is this safeguard actually on the path?"** An exhaustive
visitor does not protect you from not calling it. (Framing sharpened by the `oscortex_core` side.)

**How to run the audit, which is not the obvious way.** The `oscortex_core` side sharpened the
question and the improvement is real: ask **"what would have to be true for this refusal to be
correct, and is it?"** — NOT "is the stated hazard still real?". The second invites re-reading the
comment, which is the thing that misled everyone. The first forces reconstructing the argument from
the code, which is where the answer actually was.

**Fourth instance, and the sharpest (2026-08-21).** `_collectLoopCarriedCandidates` fell off its end
SILENTLY for unrecognized statements. `continue` wraps a loop body in a `LabeledStatement`, which it
did not know, so it collected nothing, the loop header got no phi parameters, and the emitted code
branched to itself — a hang with no diagnostic (ADR-0047). This is the worst version of the pattern
because the consequence of a missed shape is *wrong code* rather than a refusal: nothing downstream is
malformed, so nothing downstream can report it. The walker is now exhaustive and throws on anything
unlisted.

**Third instance, and it makes this a class (2026-08-21).** `u64(first - 1)` was rejected with "the
argument must be an integer literal or a compile-time integer constant" while being exactly that
(ADR-0046). The common thread across all three is now clear and is more useful than the individual
fixes: **each refusal was written as a SHAPE check — matching AST node types — while its message
described a SEMANTIC rule.** A shape check documented in semantic language drifts from its own
documentation the moment a new shape expresses the same meaning. Note ADR-0037 had already widened
this same check once, by adding a shape rather than by evaluating; widening a pattern-match is what
invited the identical bug a second time.

**First audit run, `break`/`continue` (2026-08-21).** Applying that question produced a better result
than a yes/no:

- `continue` is a branch to the loop header with the current loop-variable values, which is
  *byte-identical to the back edge `_lowerWhile` already emits*. Genuinely free.
- `break` is a branch to `exitBlockId` — and the finding is not "break is missing". It is that
  **`exitBlockId` carries an unstated single-predecessor assumption.** It is created with NO block
  parameters, and the exit restores values from the header's phi params. That is correct *only
  because* the exit is reachable through exactly one edge (the header's false branch). Add a `break`
  and a body that assigns a loop variable then breaks would read the pre-body value at the exit.

That precondition was nowhere in the code or the comments. So the refusal was right, for a reason
nobody had written down and which the stated reason did not mention.

**The invariant that audit exposed, recorded here because it is upheld everywhere and stated
nowhere:** *a DC-IR block needs parameters if and only if it has more than one predecessor.* Checked
against every block-creation site in `dcc-lower`:

| block | params? | predecessors |
|---|---|---|
| `thenBlockId`, `elseBlockId` | no | 1 (a `CondBranch` edge) |
| `bodyBlockId` | no | 1 (the header's true edge) |
| `errBlockId`, `okBlockId` (`Result.propagate`) | no | 1 each |
| `exitBlockId` | no | 1 today — **2+ the moment `break` exists** |
| `mergeBlockId` (if/else) | **yes** | 2 |
| `condBlockId` (loop header) | **yes** | 2 (entry + back edge) |

The rule holds in all six existing cases. `break` is the first thing that would break it, and it
would do so silently — the emitted IR is still well-formed, the values are just wrong.

**Cost of the workaround:** each refusal is individually honest, so nothing is hidden. The cost is
that downstream consumers discover which ones were merely untested, mid-way through building
something else. The remaining unaudited refusals: getters/setters on `HeapObject` (ADR-0043 —
untested, not unresolved) and heap-typed field stores (escalation 0006). Heap locals in loop bodies
used to head this list as "genuinely unresolved"; it was, and auditing it produced the
per-iteration release policy (GAP-0050) rather than another sentence — the refusal was correct for
the release policy that existed, so removing it meant supplying the guarantee, not deleting the
check. The remaining sliver, a heap local declared in an `if`-branch that falls through, is an
if/else-merge refusal and is recorded under GAP-0050 with the others.

## GAP-0036 — Port I/O is optimization-safe by ACCIDENT, not by design (now tested)

**Domain:** dc-ir, backend (M2, downstream: `oscortex_core`)
**Status:** RESOLVED as a test gap (2026-08-21); the underlying accident remains

ADR-0041 made `Pointer<T>` load/store volatile. It does not apply to `Port.outb`/`Port.inb` at all —
those are `PortOut`/`PortIn`, a separate code path that lowers to LLVM `asm sideeffect` (ADR-0029).

So port I/O survives `-O2` because of a decision made months earlier, for an unrelated reason, by
someone not thinking about optimization. That is a real property with a real consequence:
`oscortex_core`'s UART output polls the 16550 Line Status Register in a loop through `Port.inb`, and if
that read were hoisted out of the loop the poll would spin forever on a stale value. **No wrong bytes,
no crash, no diagnostic — the machine just stops.** Raised by the kernel side, who own the code that
would hang.

Until now, `tests/conformance/volatile/` asserted nothing about `PortIn`/`PortOut` at any optimization
level. The property was load-bearing and untested.

**Resolution (test side).** `examples/m2-port-poll/` plus step 4 of `tests/conformance/volatile/`:
the emitted IR must contain `sideeffect`; a port read in a polling loop must remain loop-resident at
-O0/-O1/-O2/-O3/-Os, verified by locating the read's address and requiring a backward branch to target
at or before it; and three writes to the same port with different values must all survive, since each
is a distinct side effect the hardware observes in order.

**What is NOT resolved:** the safety is still incidental. Nothing in the design says "port I/O must be
`sideeffect`" — an ADR says it, and a test now pins it, but the two are connected only by this gap
entry. A future rework of port lowering that drops `sideeffect` would fail the test, which is the
point, but the *reason* it matters lives in prose rather than in the type system.

Honest limit of the test, recorded in the harness too: the IR-level assertion is the discriminator.
Stripping `sideeffect` from the emitted IR fails it. The codegen half did NOT trip on that same
stripped IR, because LLVM happened not to exploit the freedom — the read's result is used, so it was
kept anyway. The codegen check is a backstop against an optimizer that does exploit it, not a test of
the IR check.

## GAP-0035 — M3's benchmark suite cannot be WRITTEN in DCDart; the gate is unblocked but not reachable

**Domain:** language surface (M3)
**Status:** OPEN — and it is the honest statement of where the project actually is

ADR-0041 (volatile) and ADR-0042 (`-O2`) removed the two things that would have made an M3 measurement
*wrong*. They did not make it *possible*. `ROADMAP.md` names the suite:

> at minimum a JSON parser, a hashmap-heavy workload, a tree/graph traversal, a string-processing
> pass, and a closure-heavy functional workload

None of the five can be written today. Probed each prerequisite against the real compiler rather than
inferring from the gaps file:

| prerequisite | status | blocks |
|---|---|---|
| generics / monomorphization | **RESOLVED** — functions 2026-08-22 (ADR-0052), generic CLASSES 2026-08-26 (ADR-0054, GAP-0040 closed) | — (but see GAP-0054: a generic container is what makes the pass-3 aliasing hazard easy to reach) |
| closures | **RESOLVED for the BENCHMARK 2026-08-26 (ADR-0057 + ADR-0060)** — non-capturing local functions hoist to static symbols (ADR-0057), and a function can now be torn off, passed, returned and called through the value (ADR-0060, GAP-0052 closed). CAPTURING closures are still rejected: escalation 0008 **§2**, open | — for the functional workload, which needs functions-as-values, not capture. Still blocks anything that needs a captured environment |
| `String` | **PARTIALLY RESOLVED 2026-08-26 (ADR-0053)** — borrowed `Str` slices work; owning `String`/`StrBuf` still blocked on the allocator, GAP-0045 | JSON parser and the string pass still blocked (both need to *build* text, not only read it) |
| instance methods | **RESOLVED 2026-08-21 (ADR-0043)** | — |
| `null` / nullable heap refs | **RESOLVED 2026-08-22 (ADR-0049)** | — |
| heap-typed field **store** | **RESOLVED 2026-08-22 (ADR-0048)** | — |
| `for` loops | **RESOLVED 2026-08-22 (ADR-0050)** | — |
| heap-typed local declared in a loop BODY (allocating in a loop) | **RESOLVED 2026-08-26** — per-iteration release policy, `tests/conformance/loopheap/`, recorded under GAP-0050 | — (it blocked every benchmark that builds a structure in a loop, which is all five) |

Only `bool` locals passed at the time. Since then: instance methods (ADR-0043), nested loops
(ADR-0044), `break`/`continue` (ADR-0047), nullable heap references (ADR-0049), heap-typed field
stores (ADR-0048), `for` loops (ADR-0050), monomorphized generic FUNCTIONS (ADR-0052), borrowed
`Str` slices (ADR-0053), non-capturing closures (ADR-0057) and generic CLASSES (ADR-0054) have all
landed.

**The prose here used to say "two prerequisites remain: generics and `String`", which contradicted
the table directly above it on two counts** — it omitted closures, which the table lists as an open
row, and it was written before ADR-0053 landed `Str`. Corrected, and stated as the table states it:

> **Two prerequisites remain open, neither of them whole:** owning `String`/`StrBuf` (GAP-0045 —
> borrowed `Str` is done), and CAPTURING closures plus closures-as-values (GAP-0052 and escalation
> 0008 — non-capturing ones are done).

Revised again when ADR-0057 and ADR-0054 were integrated together: the third row above, generic
CLASSES, closed in the same integration (GAP-0040), which is why this now reads *two* and not
*three*. Generic METHODS on a class are still not implemented (GAP-0055).

**Revised a third time by ADR-0060 (2026-08-26), and the half that closed is not the half the
sentence above emphasised.** Closures-as-VALUES are done — GAP-0052 is closed, an indirect call
exists, and it preserves elision. CAPTURING closures are not, and are still escalation 0008 §2. The
distinction matters because the two were written as one item here and they are not one item: the
functional benchmark needs functions passed to functions, which is now available; a captured
environment needs an allocator (escalation 0002) and a capture convention (0008 §2), neither of which
moved. So:

> **One prerequisite remains for the benchmark suite:** owning `String`/`StrBuf` (GAP-0045). Capture
> remains open as a LANGUAGE gap, not a benchmark blocker.

A tree/graph traversal benchmark is now writable, and so — as of ADR-0054 — is a hashmap workload.
**Do not write the hashmap one without reading GAP-0054 first.** Its canonical shape, `map.get(k)`
followed by a mutation of the map, is precisely the get-then-mutate pattern that can put a `Release`
of an *aliasing* value between an elided retain and its use. That pass-3 elision is safe today only
because `_releaseHeapLocals` runs after the return expression — a property of how `dcc-lower` orders
a return, not a property of the pass — so the benchmark that most wants a hashmap is the one standing
closest to the hazard. A JSON parser and a string-processing pass still need text that can be
*built*, not only read.

**The closure-heavy functional workload — the one that "got no closer" under ADR-0057 — is now
writable (ADR-0060).** Passing a function to a function was precisely the missing part, and it is
what GAP-0052's closure landed. Escalation 0008 §3's separate worry, that such a benchmark would
measure unelided ARC because the elision model is structurally weakest there, **did not
materialise**: an indirect call through a `DCFuncPtr` carries its arguments' ownership in the type,
and `viaFuncPtr` emits `alloc=1 retain=0 release=0` — byte-identical to the direct spelling. Write it
against `examples/m3-funcptr/` and note that its callbacks must take heap arguments BORROWED
(GAP-0057).

**So M3 is not one unit away. It is most of the remaining language.** That is worth stating plainly
because "the gate is unblocked" reads as "the gate is next", and it is not — the benchmarks are
downstream of features nobody has built.

**Update 2026-08-26 (ADR-0060):** that paragraph is now nearly spent, and the honest replacement is
narrower rather than more optimistic. Every language prerequisite in the table above is resolved for
benchmark purposes except owning `String`/`StrBuf` (GAP-0045), for which `tests/conformance/rawheap/`
shows a program can build its own. What remains is **authoring work** — see GAP-0051b, where zero of
five are written. "Most of the remaining language" was true when it was written; what replaces it is
not "the gate is next" but "the gate is now blocked on five benchmarks nobody has typed".

**The ordering point that matters most.** `CLAUDE.md` rule 4 freezes the memory model *after* M3. The
heap-typed-field-store ownership policy (GAP-0020: does a store release the old value? retain the new
one? take over an existing reference?) is precisely a memory-model decision — and it is a prerequisite
of the tree/graph benchmark, which is a prerequisite of M3, which is what freezes it. **It must
therefore be decided BEFORE M3, deliberately, rather than inherited from whatever the first
implementation happened to do.** Deciding it under benchmark pressure is the worst possible timing.

**Cheapest path to a REAL M3 number, if a partial gate is acceptable:** nullable heap references plus
heap-typed field stores are one coherent unit — both are the same "a field holds a heap reference"
question — and together they unlock the tree/graph traversal benchmark, which is the most
ARC-intensive of the five and therefore the most informative single number. That would give a measured
overhead on genuinely allocation-heavy code without strings, generics or closures. It would not be
`ROADMAP.md`'s stated suite and should not be reported as passing M3.

**Cost of the workaround:** there is no workaround. Any M3 number quoted today would be measured on
arithmetic loops and pointer walks, which allocate nothing, exercise no ARC, and would report an
overhead near zero — a meaningless pass.

## GAP-0034 — Every `Pointer<T>` access is volatile, including bulk memory walks that do not need it

**Domain:** runtime prelude, dcc-lower (M2/M3)
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-08-27, ADR-0069) — the device/ordinary split this entry asked for is
built and verified. **BUT its performance attribution was WRONG, by an order of magnitude** — see
the resolution block at the end of this entry, and GAP-0070 for where the float cost actually
lives. Read that before quoting anything from the middle of this entry.

ADR-0041 makes `Pointer<T>.value` volatile because it is DCDart's MMIO mechanism. But it is also the
only way to read ordinary memory through a pointer, so `examples/demo-stats/` — walking a plain `u32`
array a C caller owns — now emits volatile loads it does not need. Volatile blocks vectorization, CSE
and hoisting, so a bulk walk loses the optimizations it would most benefit from.

Correctness is unaffected in both directions: volatile is strictly more conservative.

**Where the cost actually lands, which decides the fix.** It is not evenly spread, and this is worth
settling before M3 numbers arrive and the pressure is to fix it quickly:

- **`@bare` kernel code pays nothing.** Every `Pointer<T>` access `oscortex_core` makes genuinely IS
  MMIO — UART, PIC, PIT, IDT, VGA at 0xB8000, PS/2 at 0x60. Blanket volatile costs it nothing because
  it wanted volatile everywhere anyway.
- **Hosted bulk traversal pays all of it**, and that is precisely the benchmark shape: walking an array
  of scalars, which is what a JSON parser, a hashmap probe and a tree walk all reduce to.

So the fix is probably NOT "make volatile opt-in" — that reintroduces the unsafe default ADR-0041
rejected for good reason, and the failure mode is invisible. The better direction is **distinguishing
device memory from ordinary memory at the TYPE level**: a `Pointer<T>` for ordinary memory and a
distinct type (or a `@device` annotation on the pointer) for MMIO, with volatile following the type
rather than the operation. The kernel side has said it would happily annotate, because it already
knows exactly which of its pointers are device memory — the information exists in the programmer's head
and simply has nowhere to be written down today.

That also composes with GAP-0033 (no barriers): whatever type says "this is a device register" is the
natural place to hang ordering requirements later.

**Cost of the workaround:** measurable only under `-O` (which now exists, ADR-0042) and only on hosted
traversal. If M3 comes in over budget, check this before concluding anything about ARC.

**MEASURED, 2026-08-27 (NEON N2, `bench/benchmarks/matmul-f32` + `attention-f32`).** This entry
predicted "hosted bulk traversal pays all of it"; the first float kernels put numbers on it. Blocked
96³ f32 matmul — zero ARC in the hot path, checksum bit-identical to C — measures **9.244x ±0.4%**
total vs plain C, of which trapping index arithmetic is only 1.113x (kernel_trapck.c): the residual,
**8.308x**, is this gap. The emitted IR shows the inner loop as volatile-load / fmul / fadd / volatile-store per element,
so LLVM can neither vectorize (C's j-loop runs 4-wide fmla) nor hoist the accumulator; the C baseline
does both. Attention (same shape + polynomial softmax) measures 3.679x ±0.7% (residual 3.482x) —
softer only because serial exp/divide work dilutes the buffer walks. On float kernels this gap is not "measurable"; it is the
whole result, an order of magnitude above every other cost in the benchmark, and any M3-adjacent
float number is a measurement of GAP-0034 until the device/ordinary pointer split lands. Exact
ratios + attribution: the two benchmarks' manifests and `bench/README.md`.

**RESOLUTION (2026-08-27, ADR-0069) — and the correction of this entry's central claim.**

The split landed exactly as this entry recommended: `Pointer<T>` is ordinary memory (plain
loads/stores, optimizer free), MMIO moved to a distinct `Volatile<T>` type, volatile follows the
type. Verified both ways: `tests/conformance/volatile/` asserts the MMIO accesses survive
-O0…-Os with exact per-site counts plus an automated negative control, and asserts an ordinary
`Pointer` walk emits ZERO volatile ops; `tests/conformance/m1-pointer/` pins the same property on
dcc's own shipped object. GAP-0043's fence differential is written and passes. 46/46 conformance.

**The measured performance claim above was WRONG.** Same harness, same host, same day, before →
after the split:

```
matmul-f32     9.280x ±0.3%  →  9.186x ±0.5%   vs plain C   (~1%, near noise)
attention-f32  3.586x ±0.5%  →  3.631x ±0.4%   vs plain C   (unchanged)
```

The 8.308x "residual attributed to volatile" was not volatile. The emitted inner loop this entry
itself described — volatile-load / fmul / fadd / volatile-store — was read as "volatile blocks
vectorization", but removing the volatile keywords changes nothing, because the SAME loop also
recomputes every element address with 5–6 trapping u64 add/mul chains (each a
`@llvm.*.with.overflow` + branch-to-trap) and an `inttoptr` per element, and THOSE block
vectorization and hoisting all by themselves. Controlled decomposition (matmul-f32 kernel, arg
400, this host): as-emitted 540ms; with every overflow trap stripped from the IR 142ms (3.8x of
the gap); plain C 58.7ms (the remaining 2.42x: still-scalar codegen through inttoptr addressing,
plus no FMA, GAP-0068). Where the cost actually lives is now GAP-0070, with the arithmetic.

The split is still the right language change — it is the safety type this entry asked for, the
information now has a place to be written down, it made the fences load-bearing (GAP-0043), and
ordinary code stops paying volatile's (small) tax on scalar walks (string-pass/json improved
slightly). But it is NOT the float-kernel fix this entry promised, and any plan that scheduled
"close GAP-0034, get float perf" must reroute to GAP-0070. A cost this entry attributed without a
differential got quoted for one day and cost one unit of work to un-quote; the differential
experiment (strip the suspected cost from the IR, re-measure) takes minutes and should have been
run before the attribution was written.

## GAP-0033 — `volatile` prevents elision and reordering, but there are no memory BARRIERS

**Domain:** dc-ir, backend (M2, downstream: `oscortex_core`)
**Status:** RESOLVED for standalone fences (2026-08-26, ADR-0056). NOT resolved for the rest of a
memory-ordering model — see GAP-0044.

ADR-0041 emits LLVM `volatile`, which stops the optimizer deleting, duplicating or reordering an
access relative to other volatile accesses. That is what MMIO correctness needs on a single core.

It is NOT a memory-ordering model. `volatile` is not atomic, not a fence, and says nothing about
multi-core visibility or about ordering relative to non-volatile accesses. `DCDART_SPEC.md` §6 asks
for "explicit ordering", which means real barriers — `mfence`/`dmb`, acquire/release, or LLVM's
`fence` instruction. None exist.

**Resolution.** ADR-0056 implements spec §6's own spelling, `fence(Ordering.…)`, with five orderings:
`acquire`, `release`, `acqRel`, `seqCst` and `compilerOnly`. Verified in
`tests/conformance/fence/` at `-O0`…`-Os`.

**What is NOT resolved, and why it is a separate entry rather than a footnote here:** a fence is the
coarse idiom. Per-access acquire/release loads and stores do not exist, there is no written
happens-before relation anywhere in the spec, and nothing says what a `@volatile` access orders with
respect to a fence. GAP-0044.

**The honest limit of the test**, recorded here as well as in the harness: on x86-64 only `seqCst`
reaches the machine (`mfence`); TSO provides the other three in hardware, so they emit no instruction
and are asserted at the IR level instead — the same resolution ADR-0041/GAP-0036 reached for
`volatile`. And no differential test is possible today at all: see GAP-0043.

---

## GAP-0044 — Fences exist; a memory-ordering MODEL does not, and atomics are seq_cst-only

**Domain:** dc-ir, backend, DCDART_SPEC.md §6 (M2/M3, downstream: `oscortex_core`)
**Status:** OPEN

ADR-0055 and ADR-0056 gave DCDart atomics and standalone fences. Three things they deliberately did
not give it, grouped because they are one question — "what does DCDart promise about the order in
which memory operations become visible?" — and the answer today is "nothing written down".

1. **No happens-before relation is specified anywhere.** Spec §6 lists `fence(Ordering.acquire)` as a
   required primitive and stops. What `Ordering.acquire` *means* is currently "whatever LLVM's
   `fence acquire` means", which is a real and well-defined answer, but it is inherited rather than
   stated, and it is not written where a DCDart programmer would look.

2. **No per-access ordering.** `Atomic.load`/`store` are sequentially consistent with no `Ordering`
   parameter (ADR-0055's decision, and deliberately the strong default: starting strong and relaxing
   later is a widening that breaks nothing, starting relaxed and tightening later would silently
   break every program that assumed the default sufficed). The cost is real but narrow: on x86-64 a
   `lock`-prefixed RMW is already a full barrier, so only a seq_cst *store* is more expensive than a
   relaxed one — `xchg` rather than `mov`. On AArch64 the gap is wider, and this becomes worth
   measuring before `bare-aarch64` carries real code.

3. **Atomic arithmetic wraps, silently exempt from spec §4.1's trapping rule.** `Atomic.fetchAdd`
   cannot trap on overflow: the overflow is only observable after the write has committed and there
   is nothing to roll back to. Documented in the prelude, the IR node and ADR-0055 — but it IS the
   one exception to a `[LOAD-BEARING]` rule, and an exception that lives only in doc comments is one
   a future integer-model change will not know about.

**Cost of the workaround:** nothing today; `oscortex_core` is single-core and writes fences, not
per-access orderings. Item 3 is the one that could bite silently — a wrapping counter reported as an
enormous value with no diagnostic anywhere, exactly the failure mode GAP-0026 describes for unsigned
misinterpretation.

---

## GAP-0043 — The fences are currently redundant with `volatile`, so their ordering property is untestable

**Domain:** dcc-lower, backend, tests (M2)
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-08-27, ADR-0069) — exactly as this entry predicted: the redundancy
ended when the device/ordinary pointer split made ordinary `Pointer<T>` access non-volatile, the
fences in `examples/m2-fence/` became load-bearing with no source change, and the differential
this entry asked for is written: `tests/conformance/fence/run.sh` step 6 shows `handoff`'s
store→fence(acqRel)→load keeps its read-back at -O2 WITH the fence and has it store-forwarded
away WITHOUT it (fence stripped from the IR, both halves asserted). The honest limit in the last
paragraph still stands: a MIS-mapped ordering (release emitted as acquire) is still uncaught —
that is GAP-0044's memory-model work, not this entry's.

ADR-0056's conformance harness cannot run the test that would actually prove a fence works: a
differential showing that without it the compiler reorders two accesses and with it it does not.

The reason is a collision between two correct decisions. Every access in
`examples/m2-fence/fence.dart` goes through `Pointer<T>.value`, and ADR-0041 makes every
`Pointer<T>` access **volatile** — including bulk ordinary-memory access it does not need, which is
GAP-0034. Volatile accesses may not be reordered relative to one another. So on today's language the
fences are redundant with a guarantee `Pointer<T>` is already handing out for free, and removing a
fence changes no emitted code.

This is not an argument against the fences. It is a dependency worth knowing: **the redundancy ends
the moment GAP-0034's device-memory/ordinary-memory type split lands** and ordinary pointer access
stops being volatile. At that point these fences become load-bearing with no source change, and the
differential test becomes writable. Whoever closes GAP-0034 should write it.

**Cost of the workaround:** the acquire/release/acqRel orderings are pinned only by an IR-level
assertion (they emit no x86-64 instruction) plus a count. That catches a lowering that drops or
collapses an ordering, which is the regression that would actually happen. It does not catch a
mis-specified ordering — mapping `release` to `acquire` would pass the count and fail nothing.

---

## GAP-0042 — Atomic alignment was promised without checking raw addresses

**Domain:** backend
**Status:** FIXED in v0.1.3 — regression added, ADR-0075

Every atomic load, store, exchange, and fetch operation now checks natural alignment
before issuing the LLVM atomic instruction. Misaligned u16/u32/u64 addresses deliberately
trap; u8 has no alignment restriction. The guard uses the same block-splitting machinery
as arithmetic traps, preserving later phi predecessors. Raw pointer types still do not
encode alignment, so this is a runtime guarantee rather than a static alignment proof.

`tests/conformance/atomic-alignment` exercises every operation and width, every invalid
low-bit offset, aligned success, and both freestanding object targets. A test expecting
a deliberate trap failed before the fix (`load16` at offset 1 returned normally).
The existing atomic suite separately verifies locking and optimization behavior.

---

## GAP-0041 — No compare-exchange, because DC-IR has no multi-result instruction

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED IN DEVELOPMENT — platform verification pending.

ADR-0084 adds strong Atomic.compareExchange, returning the observed old value.
Since failures are never spurious, equality with expected determines success.
The backend emits one cmpxchg and extracts the previous value, preserving the
single-result DC-IR invariant. Tests exercise all four widths, both outcomes,
40,000 contended increments and misalignment traps. Broader ordering selection
and memory-model work remain GAP-0044.

---

## GAP-0031 — `@rodata` emitted homogeneous ARRAYS only, so a type descriptor's STRUCT was inexpressible

**Domain:** dc-ir, backend, dcc-lower (M2)
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-08-20) — `DCConstStruct`, a const class instance as the source form

ADR-0040 emits `[N x iW]` arrays and, via `Ref('name')`, `[N x ptr]` relocation arrays. An LLVM array
is **homogeneous**, so a mixed aggregate is not expressible. The shape a real type descriptor wants is
exactly a mixed one:

```
{ ptr name, i64 fieldCount, ptr fields }
```

That is a struct constant, and `DCConstant` has no struct node. Found by the emitter's own homogeneity
check rejecting a test that modelled a descriptor as an array — the check was right and the test was
wrong, which is the good direction for that to happen in.

So the current state is: a table of scalars works, a table of pointers works, and a **record** mixing
the two does not. Reflection descriptors need the third. This is the remaining gap between "static
data exists" and "descriptors can be built", and it is smaller than it looks — a `DCConstStruct`
node plus the `{...}` emission, with the same name-based relocation leaf already in place.

Note the interaction with GAP-0022: the C header emitter already orders structs by first appearance,
which is not guaranteed to be valid C definition order once structs can nest.

**Resolution.** `DCConstStruct` plus a const class instance as the source form:

```dart
class TypeDesc {
  final Ref name;
  final u32 fieldCount;
  final Ref fields;
  const TypeDesc(this.name, this.fieldCount, this.fields);
}

@rodata final TypeDesc pointDesc =
    const TypeDesc(Ref('nameBytes'), u32(2), Ref('fieldOffsets'));
```

Emits `{ ptr, i32, ptr } { ptr @nameBytes, i32 2, ptr @fieldOffsets }` — 24 bytes with natural C
layout (ptr, u32, 4 bytes padding, ptr) and two real relocations. Verified by dereferencing it: the
name pointer reaches its bytes, the fields pointer reaches its offsets.

Field WIDTHS come from the class's declared field types, not from the values — an `InstanceConstant`'s
field values are bare `IntConstant`s with every extension type erased, exactly as list elements are.
Field ORDER follows the class's declaration order rather than the constant's map order, because that
order IS the emitted layout. A bare `int` field is rejected for the same reason `List<int>` is.

Two things that were nearly wrong: the emitted text must be TYPE then VALUE (`{ ptr, i32 } { ... }`) —
omitting the leading type produces LLVM's unhelpful "expected '}' at end of struct" because it parses
the value as a type; and the struct is unpacked, so LLVM applies natural field alignment matching what
C would do for the same fields. A `@packed` equivalent would need `<{ }>` and has no source form yet.

**Cost of the workaround (historical):** parallel arrays, one per field, indexed in lockstep. They
express the same information at the cost of an index-correctness invariant nothing checks — precisely
what the struct now enforces.

---

## GAP-0030 — A `Store` into read-only static data is not prevented, and on the freestanding target it corrupts silently

**Domain:** dc-ir, backend (M2)
**Status:** OPEN

`DCPointer` carries no const-ness, `Store` accepts any `DCPointer`, and DC-IR has no verifier pass at
all. So nothing stops code from deriving a pointer via `Rodata.addressOf` (ADR-0040) and storing
through it.

**This is not a fault today, it is silent corruption.** `oscortex_core` maps a single RWE `PT_LOAD`
with 2 MiB pages and no per-section permissions, so a write into `.rodata` succeeds and nothing
anywhere notices. Confirmed from the kernel's own program headers, not assumed. On a system whose
premise is self-knowledge, and whose type descriptors will live in `.rodata`, the failure mode is a
corrupted descriptor — a program confidently reporting a false answer about itself — rather than a
crash. That is categorically worse than a fault and justifies more urgency than "unimplemented
checking" normally would.

**Cost of the workaround:** none available at the language level; the discipline is entirely on the
programmer. Two independent fixes, both real, neither in this unit: W^X page permissions on the kernel
side (theirs, and it must NOT be attempted as a link-script-only change — separate segments without
page-table enforcement look like protection while providing none), and const-ness on `DCPointer` plus
a DC-IR verifier on this side. The second is the general fix and is the first real argument for a
verifier pass, which DC-IR has never had.

---

## GAP-0051 — `Pointer<T>.elementAt(n)` does not exist, so every indexed read restates the element width by hand

**Domain:** runtime prelude, dcc-lower (M1/M2)
**Status:** LARGELY RESOLVED (2026-08-27, ADR-0070): `Pointer<T>.elementAt(n)` and
`Volatile<T>.elementAt(n)` exist, derive the stride from `T`, lower to one `getelementptr`
(DC-IR `PtrIndex`), and are verified by `tests/conformance/elementat/` — built because GAP-0070
showed the hand-computed-stride idiom was also the ~9x float-kernel performance bug (per-element
trapping address arithmetic + provenance-destroying inttoptr), not only the correctness hazard
this entry describes. **Still open here:** the BOUNDS/overflow policy for `elementAt`
(compiler-emitted address math wraps, deliberately un-poisoned — see ADR-0070; whether a future
form traps or inherits an allocation length is a §4.1-adjacent ADR to write before M3 freezes
rule 4), `.cast<U>()`, and migrating the remaining old-idiom call sites (in-repo examples still
compile unchanged; `oscortex_core`'s and `neon/`'s migrations are their owners' — GAP-0069's
warning applies to the kernel's device pointers regardless).

Reading an element of a static table or any pointer-addressed array is written:

```dart
Pointer<u64>.fromAddress(Rodata.addressOf(memmap) + i * u64(8))
```

That `u64(8)` is the element width, already declared one line up in `List<u64>`, restated as a literal
at every call site with nothing checking the two agree. Change the declaration to `List<u32>` and
every call site silently computes wrong addresses — plausible garbage, not an error.

This is precisely the class of bug `c_header.dart` (ADR-0034) exists to eliminate for extern
prototypes: a hand-written restatement of something the compiler already knows, free to drift from its
source of truth, with no diagnostic.

`Pointer<T>.elementAt(n)` derives the stride from `T` in one place and fixes **every** pointer user,
not only `@rodata` ones — `oscortex_core`'s `multiboot.dart` and `interrupts.dart` both hand-compute
strides today for the same reason. Raised by the kernel side, who own the motivating code.

**Cost of the workaround:** the stride literal works and is what ADR-0040's examples use. It is a
stopgap, named as one here and in the ADR so whoever first changes an element type has a chance of
finding this.

---

## GAP-0029 — The extern manifest is trusted input; reserved runtime families are now unhonorable, but everything else is taken on faith

**Domain:** testing / build integrity (spine, `CLAUDE.md` rule 1)
**Status:** OPEN — the worst case is FIXED (`tests/conformance/spine-reserved/`), the trust model is not

ADR-0038 taught `scripts/verify-freestanding.sh` to permit symbols listed in `<objfile>.externs`. The
script reads that file from disk and permits exactly the names in it. Nothing verifies that the
manifest is the one `dcc` wrote, that it matches the source's `@extern` declarations, or that it is
not stale from an earlier build.

**The part that was actually dangerous, and is fixed.** The manifest could honor ANY name, including
`dc_alloc`, `dc_throw`, `dc_orc_*` and `Dart_*` — the four families whose own diagnostics say their
presence means *the compiler emitted them* ("This is a backend bug. Escalate to E2 immediately."). A
manifest listing `dc_alloc` produced `FREESTANDING: pass`. That contradicted both the script's own
header ("still a hard failure, always") and escalation 0003's ratified wording ("keeps catching
`dc_alloc`, `dc_throw`, `dc_orc_*` and `Dart_*` exactly as before"). Verified by hand, then fixed:
those families are now checked BEFORE the allowlist and the manifest, so neither can honor them, and
the diagnostic says so explicitly. Deliberately not configurable — a safety property with an escape
hatch is one that will be escaped.

The distinction that justifies the asymmetry: every other undefined symbol is a claim about SOMEONE
ELSE'S object file, which an author is entitled to make. The reserved families are claims about our
own runtime, which an author is not.

**What remains open.** For non-reserved names the manifest is still trusted input:

- A hand-written or hand-edited manifest permits whatever it lists. There is no signature, no
  checksum, and no cross-check against the source.
- A stale manifest from an earlier build lingers next to the object. The script reports unmatched
  entries as a note rather than a failure — correct, since an unmatched entry permits nothing — but a
  manifest that is stale in the *other* direction (still listing a symbol the source no longer
  declares, while the object still references it for a different reason) would be honored.
- Nothing checks that `<objfile>.externs` was produced by the same `dcc` invocation as `<objfile>`.

**Cost of the workaround:** low today, because the manifest is written by `dcc` immediately beside the
object it describes and nobody hand-edits one. It grows if manifests ever get committed, shipped, or
merged across repos — `oscortex_core` has already ported the manifest support, so the mechanism now
runs in two repos. The honest fix is for `dcc` to embed the declared set IN the object (a custom
section, or a symbol naming convention) so the manifest cannot be separated from what it describes.
That was considered out of scope for ADR-0038 and remains so, but it is the direction.

---

## GAP-0028 — `dcc` compiles ONE library per object file; `@bare` functions in imported libraries were silently dropped

**Domain:** dcc-lower (all milestones)
**Status:** OPEN — the silence is fixed, the limitation is not

`lowerToDCModule` lowers `targetLibrary.procedures` and nothing else, so a `@bare` function declared
in an imported library is never compiled into the object. Reported by `oscortex_core`, which hit it
splitting its kernel across files and worked around it with `part`/`part of`.

The limitation is defensible for now — one source file, one object file is a normal compiler
boundary. **The silence was not.** Before this fix there were two failure modes and both were bad:

- If nothing called the dropped function, the build SUCCEEDED. The symbol was simply absent from the
  object, and absent from `--emit-header`'s output too, so the C side found out at link time or not
  at all.
- If something did call it, `clang` failed with `use of undefined value '@helperDouble'` — an
  LLVM-level message that names neither DCDart, nor the import, nor what to do.

`dcc` now refuses to build, listing every dropped function with its library and naming the
`part`/`part of` workaround. This converts a trap into a diagnostic; it does not make multi-library
programs work.

**Cost of the workaround:** `part`/`part of` forces every `@bare` function of a program into one
library. That is a real ergonomic tax on any program large enough to want files — a kernel, for
instance — and `part` is a Dart feature with its own baggage (no per-file imports; the part file
cannot be analyzed alone). The real fix is compiling a library graph into one module, or emitting one
object per library and letting the linker resolve across them; the second interacts directly with
ADR-0038's extern manifest, since a cross-object DCDart call would look exactly like an undeclared
external symbol to `verify-freestanding.sh`.

## GAP-0025 — `Pointer<T>` cannot appear in a function signature, which most real C APIs need

**Domain:** dcc-lower
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED IN DEVELOPMENT — cross-platform validation pending.

ADR-0080 lowers raw Pointer<T>, Volatile<T>, nested raw pointers and opaque
Pointer<void> in parameters, results and callbacks. The regression invokes
system libc qsort with a DCDart comparator, then tests writes, returned pointers,
volatile reads and nested pointers. C and C++ compile the generated header.
Opaque-pointer indexing is rejected with a source diagnostic. Managed-reference
arrays and const/lifetime guarantees remain their own open requirements.

---

## GAP-0027 — The conformance suite structurally cannot catch bare-metal-only codegen defects

**Domain:** testing (all milestones)
**Status:** OPEN — partially mitigated by `tests/conformance/no-red-zone/`

Every behavioural conformance harness links its `@bare` object into an **ordinary hosted process** and
runs it there (a hand-written `_start.S` plus the Linux/x86-64 syscall ABI, or plain libc for
`native-host`). That is a sound way to check what the code COMPUTES. It is no evidence at all about
properties that only differ in the environment `@bare` actually targets.

Made concrete by ADR-0039: `dcc` emitted red-zone-using code for freestanding targets, which is
correct in userland and silent memory corruption in a kernel once interrupts are enabled. The suite
was 21/21 green throughout, and could not have been otherwise — in a hosted process nothing ever
writes below RSP, so the defect has no observable behaviour there. It was found by a downstream OS
project disassembling its own kernel, not by this repo.

Other properties in the same blind spot, none currently checked: stack alignment at entry (ADR-0039's
closing note — the backend assumes SysV 16-byte alignment and documents it nowhere), `@interrupt`
calling convention once that exists, MMIO ordering and `@volatile` (GAP-0006), and anything about
behaviour with interrupts enabled at all.

Stated at its sharpest, in the words of the `oscortex_core` side that found the bug: **the kernel is
currently DCDart's only real `@bare` test, and that is a dependency in the wrong direction.** A
language project whose freestanding guarantees can only be validated by a downstream consumer has
outsourced its own acceptance criteria.

**2026-08-20: this is now three for three, and it is a property rather than a pattern.** Every
bare-metal-only defect found so far was found OUTSIDE this suite, and in each case the suite
structurally could not have found it:

| defect | how the suite missed it |
|---|---|
| red zone (ADR-0039) | `@bare` objects run inside hosted processes, where the red zone is legitimate |
| reserved symbols honorable by manifest (GAP-0029) | no test ever asked the checker to reject something |
| **`volatile` / MMIO elimination (GAP-0006)** | `m1-pointer` asserts the returned VALUE, which stays correct after the load is deleted |

**And "run the kernel harnesses as acceptance" is a stopgap, not the fix.** That is the obvious
response and it is not sufficient, proven today: `oscortex_core`'s byte-exact captures (433 and 544
bytes, the strongest evidence in either repo) would very likely **still have matched** with MMIO
read-backs eliminated, because the printed VALUES stay correct — it is the ACCESSES that disappear.
The kernel side offered those harnesses as the `-O` acceptance criterion in good faith and has since
confirmed they would have passed a compiler that had stopped talking to hardware.

So closing this gap requires a `dc-test --qemu` inside DCDart with targets that **observe the access
itself, not its result**: a QEMU device trace, a port-I/O count, an MMIO watchpoint — something that
fails when a read does not happen even though the value is right. Every harness in both repos today
checks what a program computed or printed. Nothing anywhere checks that the hardware was touched. That
is the actual hole, and it is wider than any single defect that has walked through it.

**Cost of the workaround:** a whole class of defect is invisible until a downstream consumer hits it,
which is the most expensive place to find it. `no-red-zone/` mitigates exactly one instance by
inspecting instructions instead of results — that shape (assert a property of the emitted code, not of
its output) is the general answer, and is worth reusing for the others. The real fix is the one
`DCDART_SPEC.md`'s own testing model already names and this repo has never had: `dc-test --qemu`,
booting `@bare` objects under full-system emulation with interrupts live and asserting over serial.
Until that exists, "the suite is green" and "this code is safe in a kernel" remain different claims.

## GAP-0024 — Signed integer division is rejected, not implemented (needs an INT_MIN/-1 guard)

**Domain:** backend (M2)
**Status:** OPEN — unreachable today; rejected loudly rather than emitted wrong

`_emitDivRem` (ADR-0036) throws a specific `BackendError` if the dest type is a signed `DCInt`.
Unsigned division needs one guard (zero divisor); signed division needs a second, because
`INT_MIN / -1` overflows and is undefined behaviour in LLVM just as a zero divisor is. Only the first
guard is implemented.

This is unreachable right now: `runtime/dc-core-bare/prelude.dart` exposes only unsigned sized-int
types, so no signed value can reach the emitter. It is rejected anyway so that adding signed types
later cannot silently inherit codegen that is wrong in one corner.

**Cost of the workaround:** none today. When signed types land, this must be implemented in the same
change — as must the signed comparison predicates (ADR-0035 selects `ult`/`ule`/`ugt`/`uge`
unconditionally at the recognition site in `dcc-lower`, NOT in the backend, so that is the place that
has to learn about signedness). Both failures would be silent.


**2026-09-14 implementation update:** i8/i16/i32/i64 and signed division/remainder
are implemented in development with MIN/-1 and zero guards. See ADR-0077 and
`signed-int`. Native and both freestanding regressions are being verified; the
entry remains open until cross-platform C interoperability and all recorded
subrequirements are checked. This is not in published v0.1.3.

---

## GAP-0023 — No general boolean NOT; `!` works only as part of `!=`

**Domain:** dc-ir, dcc-lower (M2)
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-09-13) — general NOT, boolean literals, and short-circuit AND/OR use existing comparisons and control-flow blocks; boolean conformance executes guarded division cases.

DC-IR has no NOT instruction. `!=` does not need one — ADR-0035 lowers `a != b` to a single
`icmp ne`, not to "compare then invert" — but a standalone `!flag`, or `!(a < b)`, has nothing to
lower to. `_lowerExpression` now throws a specific error naming this gap instead of the generic
"unsupported expression".

Implementing it is small (`xor i1 %v, true`, or a dedicated `INot`), but it raises a question worth
answering deliberately rather than by accident: DC-IR currently has no boolean-valued instruction
other than `ICmp`, and `DCBool` values only ever flow into `CondBranch`. A general `!` is the first
thing that would make booleans a real first-class value in the IR, which also affects whether
`DCBool` can appear in a function signature (today it cannot — ADR-0034 rejects it at the C ABI).

**Cost of the workaround:** invert the comparison by hand (`a >= b` instead of `!(a < b)`), or swap
the `if`/`else` branches. Both always possible, both a real readability tax. `&&` and `||` are
separately absent and are a larger question (short-circuit evaluation needs control flow, not an
instruction).

---

## GAP-0022 — Generated C headers emit structs in signature order, which is not guaranteed to be valid C

**Domain:** backend / FFI (M2)
**Status:** OPEN — unbuildable in the language today

`_collectStructs` in `backend/lib/c_header.dart` (ADR-0034) emits each distinct struct type in the
order it is first seen across function signatures. If a struct had a field whose type is another
struct, C would require the inner one to be defined first, and signature order does not guarantee
that. The generated header would fail to compile.

No DCDart program can build that shape: `@packed` structs hold scalars and pointers only. So this is
a latent ordering bug with no reachable trigger, recorded rather than fixed speculatively. The fix
when it becomes reachable is a topological sort over field types, which is also when a cycle (two
structs pointing at each other) becomes a real case needing a forward declaration.

**Cost of the workaround:** none today.


**2026-09-14 implementation update:** header discovery now traverses callbacks,
raw-pointer pointees and nested fields. Named forward declarations support pointer
recursion, by-value dependencies are topologically ordered, and conflicting names
or recursive by-value layouts fail explicitly. Opaque ARC handles precede structs
that use them. New regressions compile the emitted headers as C11 and C++17.
This source change is not yet in published v0.1.3.

## GAP-0021 — A fresh clone of this repo could not build at all; the ignored vendor tree was not reproducible without undocumented manual steps

**Domain:** frontend / build reproducibility (all milestones)
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-08-20) — `core/scripts/vendor-frontend.sh`

Found by cloning this repo onto a clean machine (macOS/arm64) that had never built it. `core/frontend/`
did not exist at all — `core/frontend/vendor/` is `.gitignore`'d by ADR-0005/0007's own decision (~212M
working tree plus its own nested `.git`), and nothing else under `frontend/` is tracked. Because
`dcc-lower` has a path dependency on the vendored `pkg/kernel`, **every package in the pipeline failed
`dart pub get`**, so `dcc` could not run and not one of the sixteen conformance harnesses could execute.
This was not a stale-artifact problem: it is the state of any fresh clone.

Restoring it needed three things, only the first of which was mechanically written down:

1. The sparse/shallow/partial clone command (ADR-0005) re-pinned to the `3.12.2` tag (ADR-0007) — the
   only step recoverable by reading the ADRs.
2. The workspace-detach pubspec edits (ADR-0007 decision item 2). These live **only** inside the
   ignored tree, so a re-clone silently reverts them to upstream's `resolution: workspace` form and
   `pub get` then demands all ~60 members of dart-lang/sdk's pub workspace be physically present.
   ADR-0007's own Consequences section predicted exactly this ("the detach is not a one-time patch
   that survives a re-clone... Worth a small script if re-vendoring becomes routine; not written now
   since it's happened exactly once"). It has now happened a second time.
3. A Dart SDK satisfying `^3.12.0-0`. The machine's `dart` was Flutter's bundled 3.11.0, which does
   not satisfy it — a confusing failure, because `dart` was on PATH and looked fine.

**Cost of the workaround (before the fix):** total, not partial. The project was unbuildable and every
claim in `core/README.md` unverifiable on a new machine, despite all of that code being correct and
committed. The private `dcdart-internal` repo exists specifically so this project survives a machine
switch; it covered the process docs but not the one ignored directory the build actually needs.

**Resolution:** `core/scripts/vendor-frontend.sh` reproduces the vendor end to end — clone at the
ADR-0005 sparse spec, verify the checkout is exactly ADR-0007's pinned commit
`d684a576a6aa954ae107a03b2b4e1d61c3bebe93` (hard-fail otherwise), rewrite all three pubspecs to their
detached form, then prove the result by running `dart pub get` across all six `core/` packages instead
of assuming. Idempotent; `--force` re-clones. Verified from a genuinely empty `core/frontend/` on
macOS/arm64, after which all sixteen conformance harnesses pass in a `linux/amd64` container.

## GAP-0020 — Heap- and weak-typed heap-object field stores rejected (undecided ownership policy)

**Domain:** dcc-lower (M2)
**Status:** OPEN — scalar (`DCInt`) heap-object field stores RESOLVED
(`docs/decisions/0032-if-else-merge-and-heap-field-store.md`); heap/weak-typed field stores throw a
clear error rather than guessing.

Found while writing `core/examples/demo-collatz/` (a real, hand-written program, not a narrow
conformance target): `_lowerHeapFieldLoad` (reading a `HeapObject` subclass's field) existed since
ADR-0016/0020, but its Store-direction counterpart never did — `counter.total = counter.total + n;`
threw "unsupported expression statement." Added `_lowerHeapFieldStore`, but scoped to scalar fields
only: overwriting a field that currently holds a strong heap/weak reference raises the exact same real
ownership question ADR-0027 already flagged for scalar-vs-heap LOCAL reassignment — does the store
release the old value first? does it need to retain the new one, or does it take over an existing
strong reference from the assigning expression? None of this is decided.

**Cost of the workaround:** none for the scalar case (resolved for real). Heap/weak-typed field
mutation after construction remains genuinely unsupported — a real gap for any program wanting a
mutable heap-typed field (e.g. a linked-list `next` pointer, an observer's target), not just a
theoretical one. Next step: this needs the same kind of ownership-policy decision move semantics
(ADR-0031) and scalar reassignment (ADR-0027) already flagged as undecided — likely resolved together
once a real program needs mutable heap-typed fields, not speculatively now.

## GAP-0019 — No general inline asm / `@naked` / extern-to-external-symbol FFI; only the narrow `Port.outb`/`Port.inb` primitive exists

**Domain:** dc-ir, backend, dcc-lower (M2, downstream: `oscortex_core`)
**Status:** OPEN — three of its five sub-items are now RESOLVED:
- `Port.outb`/`Port.inb` (`docs/decisions/0029-port-io.md`), the narrow case that motivated the entry;
- bitwise operators `&`/`|`/`^`/`<<`/`>>` (`docs/decisions/0030-bitwise-operators.md`);
- **extern-to-external-symbol FFI (`docs/decisions/0038-extern-symbols-and-linking.md`)** — see the
  struck-through item below. `@extern external` declarations, real `declare`s and relocations, real
  multi-object linking, verified by `tests/conformance/ffi-extern/run.sh`.

General inline `asm`, `@naked`, `@interrupt` enforcement, `@linkName` and `@section` remain
unimplemented, correctly deferred.

`oscortex_core` (a from-scratch OS being developed alongside DCDart, its own project) needed x86 port
I/O (`outb`/`inb`) for its first milestone's UART driver. Rather than build the general primitives spec
§6 ("dangerous five": `asm`, `@naked`, `Pointer.fromAddress`, `unowned`, `@noarc`) and §9 (reverse FFI —
DCDart code calling an external, non-DCDart symbol by name) describes, a single narrow DC-IR
instruction pair (`PortOut`/`PortIn`) with a FIXED LLVM inline-asm shape was added instead — real,
immediately motivated, verified against a real disassembly, but deliberately not a general mechanism.

**What's still missing, for real, when the next OS milestone needs it:**
- General inline asm (arbitrary instruction sequences from DCDart source) — needed for things like
  `cli`/`sti`, `lgdt`/`lidt`, `cpuid`, control-register reads/writes. None of these have a narrow,
  single-purpose escape hatch the way port I/O did; each would need its own case-by-case decision
  about whether a dedicated instruction (like `PortOut`/`PortIn`) or a real general `asm` mechanism is
  the right call, the same way this gap was resolved.
- `@naked` functions (no prologue/epilogue, needed for real interrupt/exception handler entry points).
- ~~Extern-to-external-symbol FFI — DCDart code calling a symbol not defined in its own Kernel IR
  compilation unit (e.g. a hand-written assembly helper in a companion `.S` file). `dcc` today only
  ever emits one self-contained relocatable object per compilation unit; resolving an external symbol
  by name is a new architectural concept it doesn't have.~~ **RESOLVED, ADR-0038.** `@extern external`
  + a module-level `DCModule.externFunctions` + an LLVM `declare` per symbol. `dcc` output is now one
  object among several: `tests/conformance/ffi-extern/run.sh` links four objects freestanding
  (`-nostdlib`) with zero undefined symbols left, links three natively and runs them, and calls real
  libc (`ffs`/`toupper`/`putchar`) with the stdout bytes checked. `oscortex_core` no longer has to
  route everything through the assembly-calls-DCDart direction.
  **Two follow-ups this opened, tracked separately:** GAP-0025 (`Pointer<T>` cannot appear in a
  signature, so most of libc is still un-declarable) and GAP-0026 (no signed sized-int types, so a C
  `int` must be declared `u32`).
  **Rule 1's meaning changed, and that change is RATIFIED:**
  `docs/escalations/0003-extern-c-calls-vs-freestanding.md` was decided by the project owner (option
  2) on 2026-08-20 — rule 1 becomes "zero undefined symbols *except ones the source explicitly
  declared*, checked mechanically." The check still hard-fails any undefined symbol the source did not
  declare, and `tests/conformance/ffi-extern/run.sh` step 3 asserts exactly that on every run.
- `@interrupt` function safety enforcement (no allocation inside an interrupt handler, compiler-
  enforced) — mentioned in `CLAUDE.md`'s coding rules as a real requirement, not yet built at all.
  **Whoever builds it also owes escalation 0003's second condition, which ADR-0038 specified but
  could not enforce because `@interrupt` does not exist:**

  > A call to an `@extern` symbol, direct **or transitive** through another `@bare` function, is a
  > compile-time error inside a function annotated `@interrupt`.

  The hazard is reaching foreign code at all — unbounded stack depth, unknown blocking, unknown
  reentrancy, none of which the compiler can see through a `declare` — not the syntactic position of
  the call site, so enforcing it needs a call-graph walk over the module's `Call` instructions, not a
  local check. A check keyed off an annotation nothing can write today would be dead code that looks
  like a guarantee, which is why ADR-0038 wrote the rule down here instead of pretending to enforce
  it. `oscortex_core` records its own M1 interrupt handlers as correct-by-inspection for exactly this
  reason.
- `@linkName` and `@section` (spec §6's linker-control row). ADR-0038 deliberately did not build them:
  the Dart identifier is the C symbol name, which covers every symbol needed so far. `@linkName`
  becomes necessary the moment a C symbol's name is not a legal Dart identifier (a leading underscore
  at top level, a `$`, a C++-mangled name); `@section` is an outbound-direction property and belongs
  with whoever needs `.text.boot`.
- `@volatile` (GAP-0006, pre-existing) — whoever builds it needs to cover `PortOut`/`PortIn` too, not
  just `Load`/`Store`: both are genuine side effects that must never be reordered or elided once an
  optimizer exists.

**Cost of the workaround:** none for the narrow `Port.outb`/`Port.inb` addition itself (resolved for
real, verified against a real disassembly, not routed around), and none for extern FFI (resolved for
real, executed for real). The cost is scope: `oscortex_core`'s next real milestone (interrupts) still
needs `@naked` and `@interrupt` enforcement, which don't exist — and ADR-0038's extern surface, while
real, reaches only integer-and-struct signatures until GAP-0025 lands. Expect this entry to keep
growing real sub-items as that work starts, not to close outright.

---

## GAP-0018 — No function-call instruction in DC-IR at all; every conformance target is a single leaf function

**Domain:** dc-ir, dcc-lower, backend (all milestones so far)
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-08-14) — see `docs/decisions/0018-function-calls.md`

`core/dc-ir/lib/instructions.dart` had no `Call` instruction; `core/dcc-lower/lib/lower.dart`'s
`StaticInvocation` handling only recognized prelude members. Every conformance target through M2's
alias slice was, and had to be, a single self-contained function with no calls out. Discovered (not a
deliberate scope cut recorded anywhere) while scoping GAP-0017's "heap reference passed as a function
argument" item, which needed a second function to pass one *to*.

**Resolved:** a new `Call` DC-IR instruction (`dest` nullable for void returns, `targetName`, `args`),
real LLVM `call` codegen in `core/backend`, and `dcc-lower` recognition of a `StaticInvocation`
targeting a sibling `@bare`-annotated top-level function (checked last among `StaticInvocation` shapes
so it can never shadow a real prelude member). Verified via `core/examples/m2-call/calls.dart` —
direct calls, a `Result`-returning callee, and a call composed with `.propagate()` with zero extra
plumbing needed — `core/tests/conformance/m2-call/run.sh` reports an unqualified PASS under
WSL/Ubuntu, zero regressions on the other six targets.

**What this does NOT resolve, on purpose (scope cut, see the ADR):** only scalar
(`u8`/`u32`/`u64`/`Result`) parameter/return types are handled — a `DCHeapPointer`-typed parameter or
return still throws (this is exactly GAP-0017's remaining item, now unblocked but not yet done). A
void-returning callee can't be called as an expression yet (only as a statement, which itself isn't
wired up — no conformance target has needed it). Recursion is untested, though nothing in the design
should prevent it.

## GAP-0017 — M2's naive Retain/Release insertion + weak references + first elision pass (RESOLVED); passes 1/2/4/5 + unowned/cycles/heap-in-loop remain

**Domain:** dcc-lower, backend (M2, M3+)
**Status:** items 1, 2 (pass 3 only), 3 (weak only), 5, AND item 6 (`while` loops, now INCLUDING
heap/weak locals in the body) RESOLVED (2026-08-14/15/16/26,
ADR-0017/0019/0020/0021/0022/0023/0025/0027/0028 + the per-iteration release policy recorded under
GAP-0050) — item 4 (plus `unowned` within item 3 and passes 1/2/4/5 within item 2) remain, correctly
later-milestone/optional/sequenced-after-the-first-pass.

`core/tests/conformance/m2-heap/run.sh` proves the *core mechanism* (real `Alloc`/`Retain`/`Release`
codegen, real heap object construction/field access from source, a real leak test passing 1000 real
cycles under Linux) — genuinely the highest-risk part of M2 per `AGENTS.md`. What M2's exit criterion
(`ROADMAP.md`: "leak-free... `weak` references nil out correctly... elision firing") still needs:

1. **`Retain` insertion at every ownership-transfer point spec §3.1 describes — RESOLVED.** In order,
   across four ADRs: local-to-local aliasing (ADR-0017, `core/tests/conformance/m2-alias/run.sh`, 2000
   real cycles); heap-typed function parameters (borrowed by default, spec §3.2 item 2) and return
   types (ADR-0019, `.../m2-heap-param/run.sh`, 1000 leak-free borrowed-call cycles + a *bounded*
   return-transfer test); a `HeapObject` field referencing another `HeapObject` (ADR-0020,
   `.../m2-heap-field/run.sh`); and `@owned` parameters (ADR-0021, spec §3.2 item 2's other half,
   `.../m2-owned/run.sh`, **1000 real cycles, genuinely leak-free and UNBOUNDED** — the first M2
   heap-signature target that didn't need to stop short of the 64-slot arena). All shapes compose
   correctly with each other and with the pre-existing naive release policy (ADR-0016), confirmed via
   a full regression run after every single addition, zero regressions at any step.
2. **Elision (spec §3.2 passes 1, 3, 4, 5) — PASSES 3 and 4 (one case) RESOLVED; passes 1/2/5 and pass
   4's general cases remain.** Earlier drafts of this entry framed elision as purely M3 scope
   ("naive-but-correct is the right M2 target") — CORRECTED after re-checking `ROADMAP.md`'s own M2
   exit text directly: *"...`dc-objdump --arc` shows elision firing on the reference benchmark" is part
   of M2's exit criterion, not M3's.* M3's own exit is specifically the ≤10%-overhead *measurement* (a
   distinct, later gate). Pass 3 (redundant-pair removal) is implemented (`core/dc-elide/`) and
   demonstrably firing — `core/examples/m2-alias/alias.dart`'s `makeAliasAndReadValue` went from
   `retain=1 release=2` to `retain=0 release=1`, verified via `dc-objdump --arc` (ADR-0024). M2's exit
   criterion text is satisfied for "elision firing." **Still open:** passes 1 (escape analysis), 2
   (borrow inference proper — proving MORE un-annotated parameters could safely skip retain/release
   than the source explicitly marks; NOT the `@owned`/borrowed-by-default *contract* ADR-0019/0021
   already built, which is the ownership rule elision would optimize on top of, not the optimization
   itself — see ADR-0021's "one wrinkle worth recording"), 5 (uniqueness/reuse analysis), and pass 4's
   general cases (below) — each a real, larger analysis, appropriately sequenced after the narrowest
   pass proved the mechanism.

   **Move semantics (pass 4) — RESOLVED for the call-consumed, single-owned-argument case
   (`docs/decisions/0031-move-semantics.md`); general cases remain.** The target this was scoped from:
   `core/examples/m2-owned/owned.dart`'s `makeAndDropViaCall` (`final b = makeBox(v); return
   dropBoxAndReadValue(b);`) now shows `retain=0 release=0` (was `retain=1 release=1`), verified via
   `dc-objdump --arc` on the real compiled source. `Call` gained `argOwnership: List<bool>`
   (`core/dc-ir`), populated by `dcc-lower` from the same `@owned` check that already decided whether
   to emit a caller-side `Retain`; `dc-elide` now lets a pending retain survive a `Call` specifically
   when it matches an owned-consumed argument, but tracks it under a STRICTLY STRONGER invalidation
   rule than an ordinary pending retain (any later reference at all invalidates it, not just an opaque
   op) — the ADR's own "critical correctness subtlety" section explains why the weaker rule that's safe
   for ordinary pairs is NOT safe here (cancelling this pair leaves the object's LAST reference handed
   directly to the callee, unlike an ordinary pair where some other reference keeps it alive
   regardless). A dedicated negative test proves a "used again after the owned call" shape is correctly
   left alone. **What pass 4 still doesn't cover**, deliberately: moving into a struct/heap-object
   field, moving on a plain variable's last read with no call involved (closer to escape-analysis
   territory), moving across a loop back-edge, and `Weak<T>`'s own `@owned` convention (no weak-count
   elision story exists at all yet).
3. **`weak` (spec §3.3 layer 1) — RESOLVED (ADR-0023); `unowned` still not started.** A new
   `DCWeakPointer` type plus `MakeWeak`/`WeakLoad`/`DropWeak` DC-IR instructions; "nils out when the
   target dies" is real, backed by ADR-0022's destructor cascade for the "dies" part and a "zombie
   slot" (strong==0 but not yet freed while any weak reference remains) for correct dead-detection.
   `core/tests/conformance/m2-weak/run.sh`: 1000 real cycles (both the "already dead" and "still
   alive" paths), genuinely leak-free and UNBOUNDED, exact zombie-slot arena counts verified at every
   intermediate step. Scope cuts: no weak-to-weak aliasing (throws a clear error, same discipline as
   ADR-0017's original heap-aliasing fix), `unowned` (a non-nilling, trap-on-dead-access variant) not
   attempted.
4. **Cycle collection (ORC, spec §3.3 layer 2, `@hosted` only) and the static cycle lint (layer 3) —
   not started.** A real `weak` mechanism now exists to build the cycle-breaking pattern on top of
   (item 3, above), and a real object-death signal exists for ORC's own bookkeeping — more concretely
   scoped than before, but still a genuine next milestone, not a quick follow-on.
5. **Destructors / direct-call cascade — RESOLVED for DCDart's current non-polymorphic scope
   (ADR-0022).** `Alloc` now writes a destructor function's address into the header's `cls` field at
   construction (only when the class has ≥1 heap-typed field); `Release`'s now-uniform codegen calls
   through `cls` when non-null, before freeing the slot. `core/examples/m2-heap-field/heap_field.dart`
   was rewritten from asserting a deliberate bounded leak (ADR-0020's original, correct-at-the-time
   state) to asserting genuine, unbounded leak-freedom — 1000 real cycles, `Release`'s own doc comment
   ORIGINALLY said this dispatch belongs entirely in the backend, and that's exactly where it landed.
   **What's still deferred, correctly:** a REAL `ClassInfo` vtable for genuine dynamic dispatch (spec
   §4.3, M5+) — see GAP-0003 (retitled) and ADR-0022's "Rejected alternative" for why a full vtable
   would be premature complexity while every heap object's concrete class is still always statically
   known.
6. **`while` loops over scalar-only bodies — RESOLVED (ADR-0028); heap/weak locals inside a loop body
   remain unsupported, plus `for`/`do-while`/`break`/`continue`/nested loops.** This item used to say
   "loops with heap locals — unverified," implying loops existed and only the heap-local interaction
   was untested; that was corrected once, then resolved for real here. A real loop needed two
   independent things: mutable local variables (ADR-0027) and new DC-IR control flow for back-edges
   (this ADR) — both now exist. `_lowerStatement` recognizes `WhileStatement`, threading every
   loop-carried scalar local through a block-parameter loop header (DC-IR already represents merge
   points via block params, per `ssa.dart`'s own design — no new DC-IR instruction was needed).
   `core/examples/m2-loop/loop.dart` verifies both a straight-line loop body (`sumTo`, loop-carried
   variable threading) and a nested early-`return` inside a loop body (`firstAtLeast`, composing the
   loop with `_lowerIf`'s existing guard-clause pattern) — 50 + 19×15 checks, all correct. **A real
   backend bug was found and fixed along the way** (ADR-0028's own "bug found along the way" section):
   `phi`-node predecessor labels were computed from a DC-IR block's nominal label, not the REAL final
   LLVM label after internal sub-block splitting (arithmetic overflow trapping, `Alloc`'s OOM check,
   `Release`'s destructor path, `WeakLoad`'s dead/alive split all do this) — latent since M0, invisible
   until a loop's back edge became the first non-empty-args branch to follow a block containing
   arithmetic. Fixed via a two-pass emission restructure in `core/backend/lib/llvm_emit.dart`; zero
   regressions across the full 14-target suite. **What was unsupported when this was written, and
   what became of it:** nested loops (ADR-0044), `break`/`continue` (ADR-0047), `for` (ADR-0050) and
   — as of 2026-08-26 — heap/weak locals declared inside a loop body, via the per-iteration release
   policy recorded under GAP-0050 and asserted by `tests/conformance/loopheap/`. Each was a real
   `DccLowerError` rather than a mis-scoping while it stood, which is why removing them was a
   matter of supplying the missing guarantee rather than of hunting silent wrong answers.
   `do-while` and `for-in` remain unsupported. **What was already proven before this ADR, closing
   ADR-0018's own "recursion is untested" flag**: a self-recursive `@bare` function works with ZERO new
   lowering logic (`Call`'s design, ADR-0018, already handled it correctly) —
   `core/examples/m2-recursion/recursion.dart` verifies recursive calls plus a heap object allocated
   fresh at every recursion level, releasing correctly in LIFO order, depths 0-60. Recursion remains a
   real alternative for "iterate toward a base case" but is not a substitute for the general loop this
   item now provides (no iterating over a collection, no `for`, no `break`).

**Cost of the workaround:** none for items 1/2(passes 3 and 4's resolved case)/3(weak)/5/6 (resolved
for real, not worked around). Item 4 (cycle collection/ORC) is correctly M3+/later: `ROADMAP.md`'s own M2 work list
("Retain/release insertion, destructors, weak/unowned, escape analysis, borrow inference,
redundant-pair removal, move semantics, uniqueness/reuse") never mentions cycle collection at all —
only spec §3.3's own layer numbering (this file's earlier framing) suggested otherwise. `unowned`
(item 3's other half) is genuinely optional until a real use case needs it.

**Next step:** item 2's remaining passes — escape analysis (1), borrow inference proper (2), move
semantics' general cases (4), uniqueness/reuse (5) — are each real, larger analyses; pick whichever a
real workload pressures first rather than building them all speculatively. Cycle collection and
`unowned` remain correctly deferred until a real use case needs them.

## GAP-0001 — No toolchain vendored, M0 unbuildable and unverifiable

**Domain:** frontend / backend (M0)
**Status:** fully resolved — see GAP-0005, also now closed

As of 2026-08-13, this is fully resolved as originally scoped:

1. `dart 3.12.2` and `clang`/`llvm-nm` (LLVM 22.1.8) installed via winget.
2. `dart-lang/sdk`'s `pkg/front_end`/`pkg/kernel`/`pkg/_fe_analyzer_shared` vendored at
   `core/frontend/vendor/dart-sdk/`, pinned to the `3.12.2` tag, `pub get` resolves cleanly. See
   ADR-0005/0007.
3. **`dcc build --mode bare add.dart -o add.o` now actually works and produces a real object file**
   (`core/dcc-lower` + `core/backend` are implemented — see ADR-0008 for the frontend strategy: an
   extension-type prelude, `core/runtime/dc-core-bare/prelude.dart`, lets real unmodified
   `front_end` parse `@bare`/`u64` syntax with zero source changes; `dcc-lower` walks the resulting
   Kernel IR via the vendored `pkg/kernel`; `backend` emits real LLVM IR text from the resulting
   `DCFunction` and shells to `clang -c`).
4. **`core/scripts/verify-freestanding.sh` reports `FREESTANDING: pass` against that real,
   `dcc`-produced `add.o`.** Not a hand-written `.ll` this time — the actual pipeline's own output.
5. **The arithmetic is verified correct**: the same real `dcc_lower`/`backend` code, re-targeted to
   the native host triple (since the ELF-targeted object can't link on native Windows — see GAP-0005),
   was compiled, linked against `main.c`, and run: exit code 5, i.e. `add(2, 3) == 5`.

**What this does NOT claim:** `core/tests/conformance/m0/run.sh` — the actual mechanical exit-
criterion check — does not report `M0: PASS` on this host, because its own step 3 (link the
freestanding ELF object against `main.c` and run it) correctly and honestly refuses to run on a
non-Linux host rather than fake success. See GAP-0005. The *code path* that step would exercise
(dcc-lower + backend, just re-targeted) has been proven correct per point 5 above; the *literal*
exit criterion — the same object that passed step 2, linked and run — has not been demonstrated on
this host and needs Linux/QEMU to complete, consistent with `DCDART_SPEC.md`'s own testing model for
`@bare` code.

---

## GAP-0005 — M0's literal exit criterion unverified on this host (Windows, no QEMU); code path proven, exact artifact not

**Domain:** backend / testing (M0)
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-08-13) — verified for real under WSL2/Ubuntu

`core/tests/conformance/m0/run.sh` step 3 links the real, `dcc`-produced, freestanding
(`x86_64-unknown-none-elf`) `add.o` against `main.c` and runs the result, asserting exit code 5. This
needed a Linux host (Windows can't link ELF natively) — installed WSL2 + Ubuntu, `clang`/`llvm-nm`
(apt) and the matching Dart SDK (Linux x64 tarball, same `3.12.2` version as Windows), re-ran
`pub get` for `dc-ir`/`dcc-lower`/`backend`/`dcc` under the Linux Dart SDK (Windows-generated
`package_config.json` files don't resolve from Linux paths), then ran the actual conformance harness
unmodified from inside WSL (`/mnt/c/...` mount, no file copying needed).

**Result: `M0: PASS — dcc build -> verify-freestanding pass -> freestanding link -> add(2,3) == 5`.**
A real, unqualified pass on the literal exit criterion, no host-limitation caveat needed anymore. The
same run also confirmed `M1-pointer` and `M1-struct` pass unqualified — see their own entries.

**One real hiccup along the way, worth recording:** `wsl -d Ubuntu`'s *first* launch hung
indefinitely — it was waiting on an interactive Unix username/password prompt with no attached stdin,
which a non-interactive automation shell can never answer. Killed the stuck `wsl.exe`/`wslhost.exe`
processes, ran `wsl --shutdown` to reset the WSL2 VM cleanly, then relaunched with `wsl -d Ubuntu
--user root` to bypass the interactive setup entirely. Worth knowing if this needs doing again on a
fresh machine: don't wait on a hung first WSL launch, use `--user root`.

**Cost of the workaround:** none — this was a real capability gap (no Linux-linkable host), now
actually closed, not routed around.

**Correction (2026-08-26) — this gap was cited for something it does not cover.** Seventeen
conformance harnesses carried the text `see docs/known-gaps.md GAP-0005` next to a hard `fail` on
any non-Linux host. That is *not* what this entry is about: this entry is about M0's exit criterion
being unverifiable from a Windows host, and it is RESOLVED. Anyone who followed the citation found a
closed gap and reasonably concluded the limitation had been dealt with. It had not — the suite could
not run on macOS at all. See **GAP-0048**, which is the real entry for that defect. A citation
pointing at a resolved gap is worse than no citation, because it answers the question wrongly
instead of leaving it open.

## GAP-0007 — Result<T,E>/`?` propagation

**Domain:** dcc-lower, dc-ir, backend (M1 clause 3)
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-08-13) — M1's third and final exit-criterion clause is done and verified

`ROADMAP.md` M1's third exit-criterion clause: "returns `Result<u64, Err>` through `?` propagation."

1. **RESOLVED (escalations/0001-question-mark-syntax.md):** `?` itself is not valid Dart syntax.
   **Decided:** a named-method approximation (`.propagate()`, recognized by `dcc-lower` the same way
   `.value`/field getters are) rather than forking `pkg/front_end`'s parser — the fork can't be
   verified here (no CFE regression suite, no expert review), the approximation can. The vendored
   front_end (ADR-0005/0007) stays ready for real syntax later.
2. **RESOLVED (ADR-0013):** `ICmp` added to `core/dc-ir`, lowered to LLVM `icmp` in `core/backend`,
   verified correct including the unsigned-vs-signed edge case (`ugt` on `0xFFFF...FFFF` vs `1`).
3. **RESOLVED (ADR-0014):** `Result<T,E>`'s value representation — `DCStruct` (already existed,
   previously only used descriptively by ADR-0011's pointer-backed pattern) reused as a genuine
   *by-value* aggregate type, with new `MakeStruct`/`ExtractField` DC-IR instructions lowering to
   LLVM `insertvalue`/`extractvalue`. Verified correct with a hand-built `{tag,payload}`
   construct-then-extract test, 4 cases, still freestanding. `core/runtime/dc-core-bare/prelude.dart`
   gained `Result` (`.ok`/`.err` factories, `.propagate()`) and `u64 operator <` (needed for a
   real `if` condition — verified its Kernel IR shape too: synthesizes as `u64|<`, same pattern as
   `u64|+`). All the Kernel IR shapes `dcc-lower` would need to recognize (`IfStatement.condition`/
   `.then`/`.otherwise`, `Result.ok`/`.err` as factory calls, `.propagate()` as an instance
   invocation) are empirically confirmed against real compiled output — this is genuinely
   implementation-ready, not just planned.
4. **RESOLVED — turned out not to be a real bug for DCDart's actual target.** While verifying the
   full wire-up, a hand-built test exposed a real *local* problem: `define {i64,i64} @f(...)`
   returning a raw LLVM aggregate did not match what `clang`/`gcc` expect for a C struct return on
   `x86_64-w64-windows-gnu` (Windows x64's ABI) — confirmed with a failing test
   (`makePair(111,222)` read back wrong). **Deliberately not guess-fixed at the time** — that mismatch
   was against the Windows-native retarget used only as a verification proxy (GAP-0005), not against
   `@bare`'s actual target. Once WSL/Ubuntu was available (GAP-0005), re-ran the identical test under
   real `x86_64-linux-gnu` (SysV): **`core/backend`'s existing, unmodified emission is correct** —
   SysV classifies a `{i64,i64}` struct (two plain-integer fields, ≤16 bytes) as a two-register
   return, exactly what was already being emitted. No backend change was needed. The Windows mismatch
   was real but irrelevant — a property of a host DCDart was never targeting, not of the compiler.
5. **RESOLVED — written, then fully verified.** `core/dcc-lower/lib/lower.dart`'s
   `_BareFunctionLowerer` was generalized from a flat single-block instruction list to a real block
   builder (`_startBlock`/`_finishBlock`/`_addInstr`, tracking `_blockOpen` so a statement after
   control flow that already returned on every path is a clear error, not silently mis-lowered) and
   now handles `IfStatement` (guard-clause style: every written branch must terminate; an `if`
   without `else` leaves the false path open as the fallthrough continuation), `Result.ok`/`.err`
   (→ `MakeStruct`), `.propagate()` (→ `ExtractField` + `ICmp` + `CondBranch`, checking the enclosing
   function's return type actually is `Result`), and `u64(<literal>)` construction (a shape hit while
   writing the conformance example: `StaticInvocation` targeting `u64|constructor#`).

   `core/examples/m1-result/result_demo.dart` (three functions: a plain guard-clause `Result`
   producer, and two exercising `.propagate()`'s Ok-continue and Err-early-return paths) builds via
   real `dcc build --mode bare`, passes `verify-freestanding.sh`, and — under WSL/Ubuntu —
   `core/tests/conformance/m1-result/run.sh` **reports an unqualified PASS**: real freestanding link,
   real run, all four checked values (`checkPositive(0)`→Err(999), `checkPositive(42)`→Ok(42),
   `doubleIfPositive(7)`→Ok(7) via `.propagate()`'s Ok path, `alwaysPropagatesErr(555)`→Err(555) via
   `.propagate()`'s Err path) came back exactly correct.

**Resolution summary:** every sub-item resolved. M1's third exit-criterion clause is genuinely done —
representation, primitives, `dcc-lower` source-level wiring, and runtime correctness on the real
target all verified, not assumed. See `core/docs/decisions/0014-result-value-representation.md` for
the full decision record.

## GAP-0006 — `Pointer<T>` load/store carry no `@volatile` guarantee

**Domain:** dc-ir, backend (M1)
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-08-20) for elision/reordering — `Pointer<T>` load/store are now volatile
(ADR-0041, `tests/conformance/volatile/`). Memory ORDERING (barriers, spec §6's "explicit ordering")
remains unimplemented and is tracked separately as GAP-0033.

**2026-08-20 — measured, and it is worse than "unimplemented".** `examples/m1-pointer/mmio.dart` is the
M1 exit criterion: write a memory-mapped register, read it back. Its emitted IR, compiled for
`x86_64-unknown-none-elf`:

```
-O0 (what dcc ships today)      -O2 (the same IR)
  movl %esi, (%rdi)   store       movl %esi, %eax     <- returns what it wrote
  movl (%rdi), %eax   load        movl %esi, (%rdi)
  retq                            retq                <- THE LOAD IS GONE
```

At `-O2` LLVM legally eliminates the read-back, because the load is not marked `volatile`. For a real
hardware register the read-back IS the operation — status bits change, write-only bits read
differently, devices acknowledge on read. And **`tests/conformance/m1-pointer/run.sh` still passes**,
because the returned value is correct; only the hardware semantics are destroyed. That is precisely
the failure class GAP-0027 describes: the suite links `@bare` objects into hosted processes where
nothing observes a missing MMIO read.

Marking the same two instructions `volatile` makes the `-O2` output **byte-identical to `-O0`**,
verified. So the fix is understood and narrow; it is the sequencing that matters.

**Consequence for ordering:** `-O` must NOT be enabled before this. Every `Pointer<T>.value` access in
`oscortex_core` — UART, PIC, PIT, IDT — is an MMIO or MMIO-like access whose load or store the
optimizer may drop or reorder. The kernel already knows about one instance and routed around it by
hand: its `tick_count` extern exists because a plain `Pointer<u64>` load in a wait loop is legally
hoistable, and at `-O` that hoist becomes real. There is no reason to think it is the only one; nothing
has ever optimized this code.

---

**Status:** open, low urgency

`DCDART_SPEC.md` §6 requires `@volatile` MMIO access to never be reordered or elided by the
compiler. `core/dc-ir`'s `Load`/`Store` (added for `Pointer<u32>`, ADR-0010) carry no such marker,
and `core/backend/lib/llvm_emit.dart` emits plain (non-`volatile`) LLVM `load`/`store`.

**Cost of the workaround:** none paid yet — `dcc build` runs no LLVM optimization passes at all
right now (straight `clang -c` on hand-emitted IR, no `-O` level, no separate `opt` invocation), so
there is nothing today that would actually reorder or eliminate these loads/stores. The gap is real
but dormant: it becomes a correctness bug the moment optimization passes are introduced, not before.

**Next step:** when optimization passes are added (or when a real `@volatile` conformance test is
written), decide how volatility is represented in DC-IR — a flag on `Load`/`Store`, or separate
`VolatileLoad`/`VolatileStore` instructions — and thread `@volatile` recognition through
`core/dcc-lower`. Not designed now because guessing the DC-IR-level shape before a second real use
case (is volatility ever combined with other Load/Store variants? does `Atomic<u32>` want the same
mechanism?) risks the wrong shape, per this project's own "don't design past what's needed"
discipline.

## GAP-0002 — dcc CLI skeleton written but never executed

**Domain:** frontend / dcc (M0)
**Status:** resolved

**Resolution (2026-08-13):** now that `dart` is installed (GAP-0001), `dcc.dart` was actually run:
`--help` (exit 0), a missing-input-file invocation (exit 65, correct message), and a valid
`build --mode bare` invocation against the real `add.dart` (exit 1, throws
`PipelineNotImplementedError` with an accurate message, writes no output file). All match the
designed behavior. The error message itself was stale (claimed "no clang/llvm-nm in this
environment," no longer true, and claimed `core/frontend/` was empty, no longer true post-GAP-0001)
and was corrected in `core/dcc/lib/pipeline.dart`. Original text preserved below for the record.

`core/dcc/` now has a real argument parser for `dcc build --mode <bare|hosted> <input.dart>
-o <output.o>` (`core/dcc/bin/dcc.dart`, `lib/cli_args.dart`, `lib/pipeline.dart`) plus a
`runBuild()` seam that throws `PipelineNotImplementedError` and touches no filesystem output,
per `SKILL.md`'s rule against stubs that fake success. See
`core/docs/decisions/0002-dcc-bootstrap-language.md` for why it's plain hosted Dart.

This is downstream of GAP-0001, not a separate blocker: no `dart` executable exists in this
environment, so none of `core/dcc/bin/dcc.dart`'s code paths — argument parsing, the help
path, the missing-input-file path, the `PipelineNotImplementedError` path — have actually been
run. The implementation was reviewed by hand only.

**Cost of the workaround (there isn't one; same as GAP-0001):** do not report the `dcc` CLI as
"done" or "working" anywhere until it has actually been run against both valid and invalid
invocations on a machine with a Dart SDK.

**Next step:** once GAP-0001's toolchain vendoring lands, run
`dart core/dcc/bin/dcc.dart build --mode bare core/examples/m0-seam/add.dart -o add.o` and a
handful of deliberately-malformed invocations (missing `--mode`, bad mode value, missing input,
nonexistent input file, no arguments, `--help`) to confirm exit codes and messages match
`core/dcc/README.md`. Close this gap once confirmed, independently of GAP-0001 (that gap closes
when the CFE is vendored and the pipeline is real; this one closes when the CLI skeleton itself
is proven to run correctly).

---

## GAP-0003 — DC-IR has no heap-object / `ClassInfo` layout yet

**Domain:** backend (dc-ir)
**Status:** RESOLVED for the non-polymorphic destructor-cascade case (2026-08-15, ADR-0022); a REAL
`ClassInfo` vtable for dynamic dispatch remains open, correctly deferred to M5+

`core/dc-ir/types.dart` defines `DCHeapPointer(pointee)` — a `DCType` distinct from the raw-pointer
`DCPointer`, used to type `Retain`/`Release`'s operand (`core/dc-ir/instructions.dart`) so ARC ops
have a real type to check against. `pointee` is still always the `DCVoid()` placeholder (unchanged) —
DC-IR does not track a heap object's concrete field layout as part of the TYPE itself.

**Resolved:** a `HeapObject` holding a reference to another `HeapObject` now correctly releases it
when the parent dies, cascading to arbitrary depth — `Alloc` (`core/dc-ir`) gained an optional
`destructorName`, written into the object header's `cls` field at construction (spec §3.1); `Release`
needed no shape change at all, its codegen now uniformly checks `cls` and calls through it if
non-null. `dcc-lower` synthesizes one destructor `DCFunction` per `HeapObject` subclass with ≥1
heap-typed field. Verified via `core/examples/m2-heap-field/heap_field.dart`: 1000 real nested-
construct/read/destructor-cascade cycles, genuinely leak-free and unbounded.

**What this does NOT resolve, on purpose:** this is a **direct destructor call**, not a real
`ClassInfo` vtable — every heap object's concrete class is always statically known at its own `Alloc`
site (DCDart has no dynamic dispatch yet, spec §4.3's monomorphization is M5+ scope), so `cls` is
populated with exactly one function's address, never chosen among several at runtime. A genuine
multi-slot vtable (chosen by runtime type, needed once real subtype polymorphism exists) is real,
deferred M5+ design work — see ADR-0022's "Rejected alternative" for why building it now would be
premature complexity with no current behavioral benefit.

**Next step:** when M5+ designs real dynamic dispatch, `cls` can be repointed at a proper multi-slot
`ClassInfo` struct without changing `Release`'s shape again — its codegen already only requires `cls`
to be "either null or callable as `void (ptr)`," which a richer `ClassInfo`'s destructor-slot-first
layout would still satisfy. See `docs/decisions/0004-dc-ir-heap-pointer-without-classinfo.md` for the
original reasoning behind deferring the full design, and `docs/decisions/0022-destructor-cascade.md`
for what was actually built instead.

## GAP-0004 — DC-IR's DCDart-flavored source is not yet plain hosted Dart, and `dcc-bootstrap-language` (ADR-0002) sets a precedent it doesn't follow

**Domain:** backend (dc-ir)
**Status:** resolved

**Resolution (2026-08-13):** `docs/decisions/0006-toolchain-bootstrap-language.md` decided
ADR-0002's reasoning applies to the whole toolchain (`dcc`, `dcc-lower`, `dc-ir`, `backend`), not
just `dcc`'s CLI entry point. `core/dc-ir/ssa.dart`'s `ValueId.index`/`BlockId.index` and
`instructions.dart`'s `ConstInt.bits` were retyped from `u32`/`u64` to plain `int`, each with a doc
comment stating the conceptual width. All future `dc-ir`/`dcc-lower`/`backend` code should be
written as plain hosted Dart from the start. Original text preserved below for the record.

`core/docs/decisions/0002-dcc-bootstrap-language.md` (written for `core/dcc/`, concurrently with
this unit) decided that `dcc`'s own implementation is **plain hosted Dart** — real `dart:core`,
runnable on a stock Dart SDK — specifically because DCDart has no working compiler yet and
writing the compiler's own driver *in* DCDart is circular. That reasoning applies just as much to
`dcc-lower`/`dc-ir`/`backend`: whatever actually builds and walks a `DCFunction` at runtime has
the same chicken-and-egg problem `dcc` does.

`core/dc-ir/*.dart` (this unit) is written using DCDart-flavored syntax per this task's explicit
brief — sized integer field types (`u32`, `u64`, `usize`) on `ValueId`, `BlockId`, `ConstInt.bits`,
etc. — which are **not real Dart types**; `u32`/`u64`/`usize` do not exist in `dart:core`. If
`dc-ir`'s actual implementation ends up being plain hosted Dart (consistent with ADR-0002's
precedent), these files as written will not run as-is on a stock Dart SDK — the sized-int fields
would need to become `int` (with explicit masking/range checks standing in for the width, e.g.
`assert(bits <= 0xFFFFFFFF)` for a `u32` field) or a small unofficial "sized int" wrapper type,
neither of which is designed here.

**Cost of the workaround:** none paid yet — nothing has tried to execute `core/dc-ir/*.dart` (see
GAP-0001; there's no Dart SDK in this environment regardless). The cost is entirely deferred: the
first agent that tries to make `dcc-lower` actually construct and walk `DCFunction` values has to
resolve this mismatch before a single line of it runs.

**Next step:** when `dcc-lower` starts being implemented for real, decide explicitly (and record as
an ADR, not silently) whether `core/dc-ir/` becomes plain hosted Dart matching `core/dcc/`'s
precedent (in which case retype every `u8`/`u16`/`u32`/`u64`/`usize` field here to `int` with
documented range comments) or whether `dc-ir` gets its own bootstrap-language exception (in which
case say why the reasoning in ADR-0002 doesn't transfer). Either is fine; leaving it unstated is
not — the next agent should not have to rediscover that these files, as written, assume types the
host Dart runtime doesn't have.

## GAP-0045 — no owning `String` TYPE; `StrBuf` is now writable but is not in the prelude

**Domain:** dcc-lower, runtime, spec §7
**Status:** NARROWED 2026-08-26 (ADR-0058) — the blocker was the allocator, and the allocator exists

**What changed.** This entry said "blocked on spec §12 open decision 2." That decision is closed
(ADR-0058) and `Heap.allocate(n)`/`Heap.free(p)` are real, so **growable text is now expressible**:
`tests/conformance/rawheap/` builds a `StrBuf` from capacity 1 to 500,000 bytes across ~19
reallocations, leak-free. M3's string-processing pass and JSON parser are writable.

**What is still missing** is narrower than before and worth stating precisely, because "strings work
now" would be wrong:

- **No `String` or `StrBuf` TYPE in the prelude.** Every program that wants one writes it, as the
  conformance target does. The prelude cannot hold it yet: its members are stubs that lowering
  substitutes codegen for, and a real DCDart implementation there would need prelude function bodies
  to be lowered like any other library, which they are not.
- **No concatenation, formatting, comparison beyond bytes, or `toString`.**
- **No UTF-8 validation.** A `StrBuf` filled with arbitrary bytes and read as text is not checked.

**Cost of the workaround:** every program needing growable text carries its own copy of the same
twenty lines, and each copy is a chance to get the ownership wrong — a `StrBuf` whose backing block
is freed twice is a corrupted free list, not a crash.

**Next step:** decide how library types live in the prelude (lowered bodies, or a second `dc:core`
library the driver compiles alongside the user's), then move `StrBuf` there. That is a driver/library
question, not a language one.

ADR-0053 implements spec §7's borrowed `Str` slice. It does not implement spec §7's owning
`String` or mutable `StrBuf`, both of which are heap types and therefore blocked on the allocator
decision that spec §12 has not settled.

Concretely missing: concatenation, formatting, `toString`, and any way to produce a `Str` whose
bytes do not already exist somewhere in memory. A kernel can name a device and compare a filename;
it cannot build a message.

**Cost of the workaround:** callers that need to compose text must own a byte buffer themselves and
construct a `Str` over it via `Pointer`. That is exactly the hand-rolled unsafe-buffer code the type
exists to remove, so the cost is paid in `@bare` call sites and will have to be un-paid later.

**Next step:** settle spec §12 decision 2, then implement `String` as a *separate type* from `Str`
(see ADR-0053's consequences — an owner bit on `Str` is the wrong shape and is called out there).

---

## GAP-0046 — a `Str` can dangle; there is no lifetime story for borrowed text

**Domain:** dcc-lower, spec §3/§7
**Status:** OPEN — reachable through foreign text in development (ADR-0081)

`Str` is non-owning by design (ADR-0053). Nothing prevents one outliving the memory it points at:
there is no ARC on it, no borrow checker, and no escape analysis. A `Str` into a freed buffer is a
use-after-free that compiles cleanly.

**Current reachability:** source literals still point into immortal `.rodata`,
but C can now pass or return a Str backed by arbitrary storage (ADR-0081).
The C caller must keep that storage alive. There is no compiler-enforced escape
or lifetime guarantee yet, so this requirement remains open and actionable.

**Next step:** decide whether borrowed text gets a lifetime discipline (a `@borrows` annotation, an
escape check, or a rule that `Str` may not be stored in a heap field) before, not after, `String`.
This is a spec §3 question and should be escalated rather than decided by whoever implements
`String`.

---

## GAP-0047 — `Str` has no C header mapping, so it cannot cross the FFI boundary

**Domain:** dcc-lower and backend
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED IN DEVELOPMENT — four-host validation pending.

ADR-0081 adds the missing signature mapping; the header's generic struct emitter
already supports the representation. Real C/DCDart calls test parameters, results
and callback results, UTF-8, binary/empty slices and unchanged pointer identity.
Headers document that Str borrows bytes and copies do not transfer ownership.
The ABI regression runs in every packaged-compiler job, including Windows x64.
Borrowed storage lifetime is still GAP-0046, not resolved by ABI correctness.

## GAP-0048 — the conformance suite reported a Linux number as if it were the project's number

**Domain:** testing (all milestones)
**Status:** PARTIALLY RESOLVED — the host gate is closed; the two-target divergence below is open

**This is the most expensive defect found so far, and it was not in the compiler.**

Every M0/M1/M2 behavioural harness linked its object with `-nostdlib` plus a hand-written `_start`
stub issuing the **x86-64 Linux** `sys_exit` syscall. On any other host the harness did not skip —
it called `fail` and exited 1. Seventeen of thirty-five harnesses failed together on macOS, and had
done so for their entire existence.

The number being quoted in status reports — "32 passed, 0 failed" — was measured inside a Linux
container. On the actual development host it was **18 passed, 17 failed**. A language whose stated
goal is running natively on macOS, Windows and Linux could not run its own conformance suite on two
of the three, and the summary line did not say so.

**Three separate things had to go wrong together, and each is worth naming because each recurs:**

1. **A harness that exits 1 for "I cannot run here" is indistinguishable from "the compiler is
   broken."** The information that would have made this visible was destroyed at the point of
   measurement.
2. **The runner had no skip channel at all** — two outcomes, pass and fail — so there was no way to
   express the real state even if a harness had wanted to.
3. **The gap was filed as a platform limitation rather than a defect.** The harnesses pointed at
   `GAP-0005`, which is about M0's exit criterion on a Windows host and is marked **RESOLVED**.
   Anyone who followed the citation found a closed gap and moved on. A misfiled gap is worse than an
   unfiled one: it answers the question wrongly instead of leaving it open.

**Fixed:** `tests/conformance/_lib/hosted-link.sh` now provides the link step. Linux/x86-64 keeps
the `-nostdlib` path and its belt-and-braces link evidence; every other host rebuilds
`--target host` and links libc. All 17 are converted and pass on Darwin/arm64. The freestanding
guarantee is untouched and was never coming from that link — it comes from `verify-freestanding.sh`
on the `bare-x86_64` object, which runs identically on all three hosts and is the **stronger** check
of the two, since a `-nostdlib` link can succeed on a symbol resolved out of a static archive that
`nm -u` would still catch. The runner now counts `skipped` as a third, separately listed outcome.

**STILL OPEN — the two-target divergence.** On the hosted path, Step 2 verifies the `bare-x86_64`
object while Step 4 executes a freshly built `--target host` object. They are two codegen targets of
the same source, so on this Mac the behavioural passes are evidence for **arm64** semantics and the
freestanding pass is evidence about **x86-64** output. Neither is wrong, but a reader could take the
pair as end-to-end evidence about one artifact, and it is not. Two agents flagged this independently
during the conversion, which is why it is recorded rather than left in the helper's header.

**Cost of the workaround:** x86-64 *behavioural* coverage now requires a Linux host or QEMU. That is
a real reduction in what a green Darwin run proves, and it is the price of the suite running at all
on the dev host.

### Two further findings from the same investigation, both worse than the original

**1. `verify-freestanding.sh` did not run on a stock Mac at all.** It used `mapfile`, which is bash
4+; macOS ships bash 3.2.57. On a stock shell every invocation died with `mapfile: command not
found`. It happened to fail *closed* only because `set -e` is on — without it, `undef` would have
been empty, the loop over it would have examined nothing, and the script would have printed
`FREESTANDING: pass` having checked **zero symbols**. A vacuous pass on the check `CLAUDE.md` calls
the project's spine, avoided by an accident of shell options rather than by design.

Fixed: portable read loop, plus an explicit check of `nm`'s **exit status** before its output is
trusted — everything downstream concludes from the ABSENCE of a symbol, so a broken `nm` is
indistinguishable from a clean object unless the status is checked. Verified under `/bin/bash` 3.2
with three controls: a clean object passes (exit 0), an object with an undefined `dc_alloc` fails
with the right diagnostic (exit 1), and a deliberately broken `nm` is FATAL rather than a pass
(exit 2). Bash 3.2 also treats `"${arr[@]}"` on an empty array as unbound under `set -u`, so every
possibly-empty expansion now uses the `${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}` idiom.

**A guard that was written and removed within the hour, recorded because the lesson generalises:**
a non-vacuity check was added asserting the allowlist parsed to more than zero entries. The shipped
allowlist is *deliberately* empty — every line is commented out, because the freestanding baseline
genuinely is zero permitted symbols. The guard turned the correct configuration into a hard FATAL,
and the negative control caught it immediately. **Asserting non-emptiness of something designed to be
empty is the same defect as a vacuous pass, pointed the other way.** A vacuity guard is only correct
where the empty case is genuinely impossible.

**2. The wrong Dart SDK produces a diagnostic that points at the wrong file.** With an older SDK on
`PATH`, the build emits ~4 KB of `The language version 3.12 specified for the package 'kernel' is too
high` — once per file in `core/frontend/vendor/`. It reads as a corrupted vendor tree and sends you
to re-run `vendor-frontend.sh`, which fixes nothing. `scripts/dcdart-env.sh` now checks the version
and names the cause once, before anything is built.

**Next step:** run the suite on Linux/x86-64 in CI so both link paths are exercised every commit, and
have the runner print the host and link mode in its summary line so no future reader can mistake one
host's number for the project's. Longer term, boot the `bare-x86_64` objects under QEMU the way
`oscortex_core`'s harnesses do — that suite does not have this failure mode precisely because it
never links a host binary.

## GAP-0049 — prelude imports still require a file path

**Domain:** dcc (CLI)
**Status:** PARTIALLY RESOLVED — explicit `--prelude` is implemented; a package URI remains absent.

`dcc build --prelude <path>` selects the prelude file, and source imports must identify the same
lexically normalized file URI. Relative paths are permitted; symlink aliases are not folded.
On Windows use a `file:///C:/…` URI in source and the native path for `--prelude`.

The previous statement that no `--prelude` flag existed was stale. The flag is implemented in
`dcc/lib/cli_args.dart` and `dcc/lib/pipeline.dart` and is used by distribution smoke tests.
A built-in `dc:core.bare` URI is still not available, so projects must arrange a consistent
prelude location rather than assuming a package import exists.

---

## GAP-0052 — DC-IR cannot call through a value: no indirect call, no function-pointer type

**Domain:** dc-ir, backend (M3 prerequisite)
**Status:** **CLOSED 2026-08-26 — ADR-0060**, `tests/conformance/funcptr/`. `DCFuncPtr`, `FuncRef`
and `IndirectCall` exist; a function can be torn off, passed, returned and called through the value.

**2026-08-27 — the thing this gap blocked now exists on the mechanism that closed it.**
`bench/benchmarks/closure-heavy/` (the last of M3's five, GAP-0051b) is built entirely on
ADR-0060's function values: every stage call is a genuine indirect call through a data-selected
pointer, and the measured result — DCDart/nonatomic ~1.15x trap-matched C — is the benchmark-scale
confirmation that the indirect call is not an elision barrier. Capture (escalation 0008 §2, NOT
this gap) was re-probed the same day and is still rejected; `tests/conformance/closure-capture-reject/`
now pins that.

**The prediction below did not come true, and that is the whole result of the unit.** The last
paragraph of this entry says every indirect call site becomes an elision barrier because
`argOwnership` is not derivable through a value. ADR-0060's answer is to put ownership **in the
pointer's type**: a `DCFuncPtr` is only ever created by `FuncRef` from a NAMED function, where the
`@owned` annotations are in plain sight, so the convention is derived rather than assumed and travels
with the value through ordinary DCType equality. `IndirectCall` has no `argOwnership` field at all —
it reads the callee's type — so `dc-elide` consumes the same fact for both call forms. Measured on
`examples/m3-funcptr`, the same program written four ways:

```
viaTopLevel:      alloc=1 retain=0 release=0     <- direct
viaClosure:       alloc=1 retain=0 release=0     <- direct, hoisted local
viaFuncPtr:       alloc=1 retain=0 release=0     <- INDIRECT
viaTopFuncPtr:    alloc=1 retain=0 release=0     <- INDIRECT
borrowViaFuncPtr: alloc=1 retain=1 release=2     <- INDIRECT, borrowed: pair correctly SURVIVES
```

Escalation 0008 §6's own four lines on `examples/m2-closure` are unmoved.

**What is still open, and is NOT this gap:** the capture convention and its `[weak self]`-shaped
language surface — escalation 0008 **§2**, untouched. A capturing closure is still rejected. And
`DCFuncPtr`'s ownership cannot be spelled in a Dart function type, which is GAP-0057.

The original entry follows, unedited, because it is the record of what was believed before the unit
ran.

---

**Domain:** dc-ir, backend (M3 prerequisite)
**Status (original, 2026-08-26):** OPEN — and until 2026-08-26 it was **unrecorded**, which is why
closures kept being estimated as one lowering

`dc-ir/lib/instructions.dart`'s `Call` carries `final String targetName` — a symbol name, not an
operand. There is no `IndirectCall` instruction, no function-pointer `DCType`, no `FuncPtr`: grepped
across `dc-ir/` and `backend/`, zero hits. **Every call DCDart can emit is a direct call to a symbol
known at compile time.**

So anything that is *reached* rather than *named* is inexpressible: a closure passed to a function,
returned from one, or stored in a field; a callback table; a real vtable (GAP-0003/§4.3's dynamic
dispatch is the same missing mechanism seen from the other side); a function pointer coming in from
C through the FFI surface ADR-0038 built.

**What is NOT missing, and this matters for scoping:** the backend already emits a genuine indirect
call. ADR-0022's destructor cascade loads a function pointer out of the object header's `cls` field
and emits `call void %clsVal(ptr …)` (`backend/lib/llvm_emit.dart`). The LLVM half is therefore
known-good — it is special-cased inside `Release`'s codegen for one fixed signature (`void (ptr)`)
with no DC-IR instruction driving it. What is missing is the instruction, a type to give the callee
value, and signature variance. This is real work in `dc-ir/` and `backend/`, but it is not research.

**Why it was invisible.** GAP-0035's table lists `closures` as one row among seven, next to rows like
`for` loops that genuinely were one lowering each. Nothing anywhere recorded that the closure row
alone needed a new IR instruction, so every plan that touched closures under-counted them. ADR-0057
landed the subset that needs none of this (non-capturing local functions, called directly) and this
gap is what the rest of the row is.

**The consequence that is bigger than the missing instruction.** `Call.argOwnership` exists so an
elision pass can tell a load-bearing borrowed pair apart from a redundant owned-consuming one
(ADR-0025's worked example, ADR-0031's pass). `dcc-lower` computes it **from the known callee's
signature**. For an indirect call there is no known callee, so `argOwnership` is not conservatively
derivable — it is not derivable at all, and every such call site becomes an elision barrier. That is
`docs/escalations/0008-closure-capture-and-indirect-call-elision.md` §3, and it is the reason this
gap is escalation-adjacent rather than ordinary backlog: `ROADMAP.md`'s M3 suite names a
closure-heavy workload against a ≤10% gate, so the benchmark that most exercises closures is exactly
where elision is structurally weakest.

**Cost of the workaround:** there is no workaround — the shapes above are rejected at compile time,
with diagnostics naming this gap rather than a generic "unsupported type". `tests/conformance/closure/`
records the elision baseline (`viaTopLevel`/`viaClosure`, identical ARC counts, pair elided) so that
whoever builds the indirect call can diff against a program that already exists and see the barrier
arrive, instead of discovering it in a benchmark.

## GAP-0057 — a Dart function TYPE cannot carry `@owned`, so a consuming callback cannot be passed to a higher-order function

**Domain:** dcc-lower, spec §3.2 / §4 (language surface)
**Status:** OPEN — introduced by ADR-0060, which is also what makes it visible

ADR-0060 makes per-parameter ownership part of a function pointer's TYPE, because that is the only
carrier that reaches an indirect call site. The convention is read at the tear-off, from the target's
declaration. But a *Dart function type* has nowhere to write it: Kernel's
`FunctionType.positionalParameters` is a `List<DartType>`, and `@owned` is an annotation on a
`VariableDeclaration`, which a function type has none of.

So `_lowerType`'s `FunctionType` case can only produce the **all-borrowed** `DCFuncPtr`, and this is
a compile error:

```dart
u64 apply(u64 Function(Box) f, @owned Box b) => f(b);
apply(dropTop, Box(v));   // dropTop takes @owned Box  -> type mismatch
```

**Cost of the workaround:** a higher-order function's callback parameter must BORROW its heap
arguments. That is the shape `map`/`filter`/`fold` already have, so M3's functional workload is
unaffected; what is unreachable is a generic "consume this and hand it to my callback" combinator.
The error is hard and its diagnostic explains the reason and the two ways out (borrow, or call the
consuming function directly) — deliberately not a silent coercion, because coercing either direction
is a double release or a leak (ADR-0060's "no variance" section).

**The honest fix is a language change, not a lowering:** syntax for `@owned` inside a function type.
That is a spec §4 surface addition AND a §3 ARC-convention decision, which `CLAUDE.md` rule 4 puts
outside an implementation unit — the same reasoning ADR-0057 used to refuse the capture convention.
It should be decided alongside escalation 0008 §2, not separately: both are "how does an ARC
convention get written down at a place Dart's own syntax has no room for one".

---

## GAP-0058 — the generated C header spells a function pointer but cannot spell its ownership

**Domain:** backend (`--emit-header`), FFI
**Status:** OPEN — introduced by ADR-0060

`cDeclaratorOf` emits a real C function-pointer declarator (`uint64_t (*a0)(uint64_t)`), so a C
caller handed one by DCDart can actually call it, and a C function pointer can be passed in — the
`funcptr` conformance target does exactly that. What it cannot emit is the `@owned` half of the
`DCFuncPtr`: C has no way to say it and no compiler that would enforce it.

**Cost of the workaround:** a C function passed where DCDart expects an owned-consuming callback must
release its argument, and nothing checks that it does. This is the same class of unchecked contract
`DCHeapRef` already carries across this boundary ("pass it back, never dereference it, never
free() it"), now with one more clause. Today the exposure is small because GAP-0057 makes a consuming
callback hard to declare in the first place; closing GAP-0057 without closing this one would widen it.

---

## GAP-0059 — an `@extern` C function cannot be torn off as a function pointer

**Domain:** dcc-lower
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED IN DEVELOPMENT for unmanaged signatures; platform verification pending.

ADR-0079 permits addresses of registered external functions with validated
signatures. The regression calls the system libc `abs` through a DCDart callback
and returns its address for C to invoke. Managed references, including those
nested inside callbacks, remain rejected until explicit C ownership conventions
are specified (GAP-0057/GAP-0019). Raw pointer signatures and a real qsort regression are now implemented in
development under GAP-0025. This entry is not proof of complete managed C interoperability.

---

## GAP-0060 — a `void` `@bare` function whose body falls off the end never releases its `@owned` heap parameters

**Domain:** dcc-lower (ARC insertion, ADR-0021). **Pre-existing — found while writing ADR-0060's
example, not caused by it.**
**Status:** RESOLVED — implicit-return cleanup is implemented and the void-release conformance suite passes (rechecked 2026-09-13).

```
consumeEmpty(@owned Box b) {}            -> alloc=0 retain=0 release=0    LEAK
consumeReturn(@owned Box b) { return; }  -> alloc=0 retain=0 release=1    correct
consumeValue(@owned Box b) => b.value;   -> alloc=0 retain=0 release=1    correct
```

The `@owned` parameter's release is emitted where a `return` is lowered. A `void` body that simply
runs off the end has no `Return` statement in Kernel to hang it on, so nothing releases and the
caller's transferred reference leaks — one object per call, silently.

Nothing to do with function pointers: the direct call `consume(b);` leaks identically. It was found
because `examples/m3-funcptr`'s void-callback shape is the first place in the repo that wanted a void
`@owned` consumer at all.

**Cost of the workaround:** write `return;` explicitly. `examples/m3-funcptr/funcptr.dart` does, with
a comment saying why, so that target measures indirect calls rather than this bug. The real fix is to
emit the release at every function EXIT rather than at every `Return` statement — which is the same
shape as the fall-off-the-end problem for heap LOCALS, so it should be looked at with GAP-0050's
per-iteration release policy rather than patched in isolation.

---

## GAP-0053 — Compiler-synthesized symbols are externally visible and land in the generated C header

**Domain:** dc-ir, backend, dcc (`--emit-header`)
**Status:** OPEN — cosmetic today, an ABI-surface problem at scale

`DCFunction` has no linkage field. Every function in a module is emitted as an LLVM `define` with
default external linkage and, if `--emit-header` is used, gets a prototype in the generated header.
That is correct for functions the user wrote. It is wrong for the ones the compiler invents:

- ADR-0022 destructors — `void BoxHolder_dtor(DCHeapRef a0);` appears in `examples/m2-heap-field`'s
  header today.
- ADR-0052 specializations — `pick$u64`, which the `generics` harness's `main.c` already compiles.
- ADR-0057 hoisted local functions — `twiceSum$dbl`, `viaClosure$dropLocal`, a whole new population.

Two costs. **The header describes an ABI larger than the API**: a C caller can see and call
`viaClosure$dropLocal`, which is an implementation detail of one function body and can be renamed by
an unrelated edit. **And the identifiers contain `$`**, which is not a valid C identifier character
in standard C (clang and gcc accept it as an extension), so a strictly conforming consumer cannot
compile the header at all.

This predates ADR-0057 — destructors and specializations already did it — but ADR-0057 is what makes
it worth filing, because hoisting turns "a few synthesized symbols" into "one per local function in
the program".

**Cost of the workaround:** none is applied; the symbols are simply public. Nothing is incorrect
today, and the `generics`/`ffi-header` harnesses pass. The fix is an `internal`-linkage concept in
DC-IR (one field on `DCFunction`, honoured by `llvm_emit.dart` as LLVM `internal` and skipped by
`c_header.dart`) — which is also the right mechanism for letting a user mark a `@bare` function
module-private, so it should be designed once for both rather than bolted on for synthesized
functions alone.

---

## GAP-0050 — there is no heap: ZERO of M3's five benchmarks are writable, and the reason is not the one being tracked

**Domain:** backend (`llvm_emit.dart`), dcc-lower, spec §12 decision 2
**Status:** OPEN — this is the M3 critical path

GAP-0035 tracks M3's prerequisites as a list of missing language features: closures, generic classes,
`String`. That framing is incomplete in a way that matters, because fixing all three would still
leave every benchmark unwritable.

**DCDart's heap is a fixed `[64 x [64 x i8]]` static array** (ADR-0015's "minimal ARC arena",
correctly labelled at the time as a first proof rather than an allocator). Measured, not inferred:

| limit | value | how it fails |
|---|---|---|
| live objects | **64** | runtime trap. `deep(64)` returns 2080; `deep(65)` traps (SIGTRAP) |
| object size | **48 bytes of fields** (64 − 16 header) | compile-time refusal, by name |
| allocation site | ~~**not inside a loop body**~~ **RESOLVED 2026-08-26** | was a compile-time refusal: "naive ARC has no release policy for a loop back edge yet". See below. |

All three fail loudly rather than silently, which is why this went unnoticed rather than producing
wrong answers — and the oversized-object case in particular is caught at compile time with the
arithmetic spelled out, which is good engineering worth preserving through any replacement.

**The third row is now closed: PER-ITERATION RELEASE (`tests/conformance/loopheap/`).** The refusal
was a lowering restriction, not an allocator one, and it was correct for the policy it guarded:
ADR-0016/0017 release tracked locals only before a `return`, so a heap local declared in a loop body
was a fresh object every iteration that nothing ever released — one leaked object per iteration.
`dcc-lower` now releases a body-scoped heap/weak local on **every path that leaves the body**: the
normal fall-through into the back edge (for a `for`, into the update block, so the update still
runs), every `continue`, every `break` — including a labelled one out of a nested loop, which
unwinds both bodies because the release depth is recorded per LABEL, not per innermost loop — and
every `return`, which was already covered by `_lowerReturn`'s whole-stack release and is now
asserted rather than assumed. `while` and `for` both, since ADR-0050 desugars one to the other.

Verified two ways, because neither alone is sufficient. `dc-objdump --arc` pins the release SITES
per function, which is what catches a release silently dropped from one path (`liveChain` 1/1,
`withContinue` 1/2, `withBreak` 1/2, `withReturn` 1/2, `nested` 2/2). And 1000-iteration runs check
`dc_heap_live` back at baseline after every call plus the computed value, which separates the two
failure modes: a missing release moves the live count, while a release placed one instruction too
early is a use-after-free that keeps the count perfectly balanced and shows up only in the
arithmetic. Both were confirmed by mutation — deleting either release site turns the target red.

**Still refused, and it is an if/else question rather than a loop one:** a heap/weak local declared
inside an `if`-branch that FALLS THROUGH to code after the `if` (`_lowerIf`'s `branchToMerge`
check). Inside a loop body that means `while (c) { if (p) { final n = Node(); use(n); } }` is
rejected while the same declaration at body scope, or in a branch that `break`s/`continue`s/
`return`s, is fine. Cost of the workaround: hoist the declaration to the top of the body. No ADR was
written for the per-iteration policy — `docs/decisions/` was owned by a concurrent session at the
time — so this entry is the record until one is.

**What it means for the gate.** M3 requires a JSON parser, a hashmap workload, a tree/graph
traversal, a string pass and a closure-heavy workload, measured at ≤10% geometric mean ARC overhead
vs C. A tree traversal is the one that looks writable today — it needs no `String`, no generics and
no closures. It is not: a tree with more than 64 live nodes exceeds the arena, and building one in a
loop is refused outright. **The benchmark that appeared unblocked is blocked by the heap, and so is
every other one.** An earlier status report in this project said "one of five is writable"; that was
wrong, and it was wrong because the arena's limits were never put next to the benchmark
requirements.

**Why an ARC gate cannot be measured on this arena even if the benchmarks were writable.** The
number M3 exists to produce is ARC overhead vs C, and C's baseline is `malloc`/`free`. A fixed-slot
LIFO free-list over a static array is not a comparable allocator: it has no size classes, no
coalescing, no fragmentation, and O(1) allocation with a two-instruction free. Measuring against it
would produce a *flattering* number that describes a program no one can write. The allocator is not
a prerequisite of the benchmarks; it is part of what the benchmarks measure.

**Cost of the workaround:** every conformance target that allocates was sized to fit under 64 — most
visibly `m2-recursion`, which tests depths 0–60. Those tests are correct and were not written
dishonestly, but the suite's green state carries no information about allocation behaviour at any
realistic scale, and no test in it would fail if the allocator were far worse than it looks.

**Next step:** close spec §12 decision 2 and implement a real allocator (ADR-0058). Removing the
64-object and 48-byte limits is the allocator's job; removing the loop-body restriction was a
lowering job (per-iteration release policy) and is **done** — see the third row of the table above.

## GAP-0051b — M3's benchmark suite: 5 of 5 now writable, 0 of 5 written

**Domain:** bench, dcc-lower (M3)
**Status:** OPEN — this is now the M3 critical path, and it is authoring work rather than compiler work

With the heap (ADR-0058), generic classes (ADR-0054), loop-body heap locals and runtime-sized
allocation all landed on 2026-08-26, the reason M3 cannot be evaluated changed. It is no longer that
the language cannot express the benchmarks. It is that **nobody has written them.**

| benchmark | writable | what unblocked it, or what still blocks it |
|---|---|---|
| tree/graph traversal | **yes** | ADR-0058 — needed >64 live objects and allocation in a loop |
| hashmap-heavy | **yes** | ADR-0054 generic classes, plus the heap |
| JSON parser | **yes** | ADR-0058's `Heap.allocate` — a program writes its own `StrBuf`, as `tests/conformance/rawheap/` does (GAP-0045) |
| string-processing pass | **yes** | same |
| closure-heavy functional | **yes** (2026-08-26) | **ADR-0060** closed GAP-0052 — `DCFuncPtr`, `FuncRef`, `IndirectCall`. A function can be passed, returned and called through the value, and the indirect call is NOT an elision barrier (`viaFuncPtr: alloc=1 retain=0 release=0`, identical to the direct spelling), so the benchmark will measure ARC rather than a missing analysis. Callbacks must BORROW their heap arguments — GAP-0057 |

**A claim made and withdrawn, recorded because the reasoning was the error, not the fact.** A status
report on 2026-08-26 said all five were writable, on the grounds that the last *heap* blocker had
cleared. That confused "the allocator no longer blocks anything" with "nothing blocks anything":
`closure-heavy` was never blocked on memory, it is blocked on a missing call instruction, and no
amount of allocator work reaches it. The general shape — a blocker clearing, and its clearing being
read as the last blocker clearing — is the same error as GAP-0050's "one of five is writable."

**Cost of the workaround:** none available. Four benchmarks produce a geometric mean over four
benchmarks, and `ROADMAP.md` M3's exit criterion is the geometric mean over the five it names. The
harness enforces this — it prints `*** NO GATE NUMBER IS PRODUCED BY THIS RUN ***` and exits 3 unless
all five ids are present, specifically so a partial suite cannot be quoted as a gate result.

**Next step:** write `tree-traversal` first — it is the shortest path to the first real M3 data point
and, with `hashmap`, carries most of the ARC the gate is measuring. `closure-heavy` is now writable
too (ADR-0060); write it against `examples/m3-funcptr/` for the shapes, and note that its callbacks
must take heap arguments BORROWED (GAP-0057) — which is what `map`/`filter`/`fold` want anyway.

**Still zero of five written.** The row above changing from NO to yes is not progress toward the
gate; it removes the last reason the gate cannot be attempted.

**UPDATE 2026-08-27 — four of five now exist in this tree.** `json`, `string-pass` and
`tree-traversal` were written on this side; `hashmap` was written by `dc-sys-21` on the
`wt-hashmap` branch (ADR-0061, the two-phase pair with `hashmap-burst`) and is now integrated onto
`main` — measured end-to-end by `bench/run-bench.sh hashmap` (identity check PASS, all five
implementations at checksum parity, DCDart/nonatomic 2.385x trap-matched C on the integration
host) and pinned by `tests/conformance/hashmap-bench/`. The "hashmap-heavy: writable — ADR-0054
generic classes" row above was optimistic in exactly the way this entry warns about: a bucket
ARRAY turned out to be inexpressible (GAP-0061, escalation 0010), so the benchmark carries a
measured trie workaround. `closure-heavy` remains the missing fifth.

**UPDATE 2026-08-27 (later the same day) — FIVE OF FIVE. The M3 gate produced its first real
number, and the number says M3 does not pass.** `closure-heavy` landed (ADR-0067): the capture
blocker was RE-PROBED rather than assumed — a capturing closure is still rejected (escalation 0008
§2 open; now pinned by `tests/conformance/closure-capture-reject/`) — so the benchmark is written
the way closures compile: heap `Env` objects (two scalars + a shared per-round `Gain` reference)
invoked through data-selected function pointers via ADR-0060's indirect calls, one-item rolling
window, serial dependency, `dc_heap_live` back to 0. The C baseline keeps its contexts on the
stack (natural C, ADR-0059). Its manifest commits to a rewrite in capture syntax when 0008 §2 is
decided. Measured clean in three consecutive full-suite runs: **1.145–1.154x trap-matched C
(nonatomic; 1.16–1.17x plain C; traps ≈1.015x; atomic 1.70x; stock Dart AOT 2.70x)**; elision
removes 3 of its 7 lowered retains — the environment-churn shape recycles one size class, which is
the ADR-0058 heap's best case, hence one of the suite's best ratios.

The first full-suite gate output (run 3 of the day, `bench/run-bench.sh`, Apple M1 Pro):

```
M3's required benchmark suite: 5 of 5 present.
Suite complete. The gate number is the geometric mean of
DCDart / trap-matched C over this suite (ADR-0059):
  DCDart/nonatomic  : 1.3073x vs trap-matched C -- OVER the <= 1.10x bar
  DCDart/atomic     : 1.6534x vs trap-matched C -- OVER the <= 1.10x bar
```

Per-benchmark residuals (DCDart/Ctrap, nonatomic): json ≈0.61x (faster than C — the ADR-0058
allocator advantage GAP-0062 warns is masking unelided ARC), closure-heavy 1.145x, string-pass
1.153x, tree-traversal 2.151x, hashmap 2.214x. **The gate is decided by the two linked-structure
benchmarks, i.e. by GAP-0062** — pass-3 elision removing almost nothing across null tests — not by
indirect calls (closure-heavy), codegen (string-pass) or allocation throughput (json). The path
from 1.31x to ≤1.10x runs through elision across null-test block boundaries, per GAP-0062's own
analysis.

Caveats belonging to this first number: (1) it was measured while another agent compiled on the
same machine — of three same-day runs, run 1 lost `json`'s nonatomic side to the 25 ms floor by
0.061 ms (its `BENCH_ARG=600` puts DCDart's fastest side AT the floor on this host; its owner
should raise it, ~600→800), run 2 lost `tree-traversal` to a mid-edit `dcc-lower` compile break
(transient, concurrent work, rebuilt clean afterwards) and run 3 lost only `json`'s PLAIN-C
baseline to noise, which refuses the informational plain-C means but not the gate quantity; the
gate benchmarks proper were stable across all three runs (closure-heavy ±0.01x, hashmap
2.19–2.21x, tree 2.15–2.18x). (2) One harness defect found and fixed on the way: `tool/report.awk`
line 423 contained literal shell-quote escapes (`'\"'\"'`) from a heredoc edit, so EVERY report
died at the M3-gate section before printing it — i.e. the gate section had never actually rendered
until today.

**Update 2026-08-27 (recorded 2026-08-28 — a recording omission, caught by dc-sys-21 challenging
an unrecorded relay):** a later same-day full-suite run, after ADR-0070's `elementAt`/GEP work
landed, measured the gate at **1.2918x nonatomic / 1.5633x atomic** vs trap-matched C (plain-C
informational 1.2992x), all five benchmarks clean, nothing REFUSED. That number existed only in a
session scratchpad log (`bench-final-full.log`) until this note — the 1.3073x above was the only
in-tree figure, so anyone citing "the recorded gate" was right to use it. Treat 1.2918x as the
latest measurement and 1.3073x as the last one taken in isolation from ADR-0070; both are OVER the
1.10x bar and the GAP-0062 conclusion is unchanged. A quiet-machine confirmation run should
replace both the next time the suite is exercised.

## GAP-0062 — elision removes 1 of 19 retains on the JSON parser, and nothing could measure that until now

**Domain:** dc-elide, dcc-lower (M3 gate)
**Status:** OPEN — measured, and it is the M3 gate's dominant term

`dc-sys-21`'s `hashmap` benchmark found that ADR-0025's pass 3 elides **none** of its ~30
executed retain/release pairs, and attributed the gate's ~2.4× to that rather than to ARC being
expensive in principle. Checked independently against the three benchmarks written on this side:

| benchmark | retains after lowering | after elision | removed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tree-traversal` | 6 | 4 | 2 (33%) |
| `json` | **19** | **18** | **1 (5%)** |
| `string-pass` | 0 | 0 | — nothing to remove |

**The cause is structural, not a tuning problem.** Pass 3 is intra-block, and **every nullable heap
field read ends its block at the null test**. Idiomatic linked structures — a tree, a sibling chain,
a parser's node graph — are nothing but null tests, so the pass is looking at a program that has
been chopped into pieces smaller than the pairs it is trying to match.

`string-pass` is the control that makes this legible: it has **zero** retains, because its buffer is
raw bytes from `Heap.allocate` and its fields are integers rather than heap references. It does not
chase pointers, so it has no alias-retain traffic, and it is also the only one of the three where
DCDart is *slower* than C. The benchmark with no ARC traffic is the one that loses; the two full of
unelided pairs both win. Which brings up the finding that matters most here:

**`json` is masking this problem behind an allocator advantage.** Its ratio is ~0.62× — DCDart
comfortably faster — while carrying 18 unelided retain/release pairs. ADR-0058's heap (no
coalescing, no cross-class reuse, bump-allocated) is winning by more than the missing elision is
losing. **Two errors of opposite sign, and the net number looks fine.** A gate read off that number
alone would conclude ARC is cheap and the allocator is good, when the honest statement is that one
is flattering and the other is expensive.

**Nothing in this tree could measure this before.** `elideRedundantRetainReleasePairs` ran
unconditionally inside `lowerToDCModule`, so `dc-objdump --arc` only ever saw post-elision counts.
Its unit tests prove *the pass fires*; they say nothing about *how much it removes on a real
program*, and those are different questions. `lowerToDCModule` now takes `elide:` and `dc-objdump`
takes `--no-elide`, so the diff above is reproducible by anyone:

```
dart dc-objdump/bin/dc_objdump.dart --arc --no-elide <src>.dart   # what lowering produced
dart dc-objdump/bin/dc_objdump.dart --arc            <src>.dart   # what survived
```

### Why nobody noticed: the pass scores 100% on exactly the programs written to validate it

Swept across every example and benchmark in the tree (`bash bench/elision-delta.sh`):

| program | retains lowered | survive | removed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `m2-closure` | 4 | 0 | **100%** |
| `m2-heap-field` | 1 | 0 | **100%** |
| `m2-owned` | 1 | 0 | **100%** |
| `m3-funcptr` | 6 | 1 | 83% |
| `m2-loopheap`, `m3-generic-class` | 2 | 1 | 50% |
| `tree-traversal` | 6 | 4 | 33% |
| `m2-list` | 12 | 9 | 25% |
| **`json`** | **19** | **18** | **5%** |
| | **55** | **34** | **38.2% overall** |

**Read the 38.2% with care — it is an average dominated by tiny programs.** The pass removes
everything on a four-retain conformance example and one pair in nineteen on a JSON parser, and the
mean of those is not a fact about anything.

The pattern is the point. `m2-closure`, `m2-heap-field` and `m2-owned` are the targets written to
demonstrate that elision works, and every one of them is straight-line, single-block, and contains
**no null test** — so every pair sits inside one block where an intra-block pass can see it. The
programs where it fails are the ones with the shape real code has: `m2-list` is a linked list,
`json` is a node graph, and both are nothing but `if (x != null)`.

So the pass has six passing unit tests and three conformance targets at 100%, and removes 5% on a
parser. **Nothing was wrong with those tests; they simply share a shape with each other and not with
real programs.** That is the same defect family as this project's other findings today — a
mechanism validated against exactly the conditions under which it succeeds — and it is why a
correctness suite could be green for months while the optimiser did almost nothing.

**Cost of the workaround:** none available. This is the M3 gate's dominant term on any benchmark
that chases pointers, and it is a fixable optimiser limitation rather than a language verdict —
which is the good news, and also why publishing a gate number before fixing it would be publishing
the wrong number.

### WHICH constraint, measured: `dc-objdump --arc --why`

"Elision removes 5% here" does not say what to fix. Three unrelated constraints stop a pair and they
need three different fixes, so the pass now counts which one fired. Measured on main at `91ce735`:

| program | elided | **blockLimited** | **opaqueLimited** | releaseLimited |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `json` | 0 | **16** | **0** | 3 |
| `m2-list` | 3 | 6 | **0** | 3 |
| `tree-traversal` | 2 | 4 | **0** | 0 |

**`opaqueLimited` is ZERO on every real program measured.** That is the decisive result, and it was
not what the reasoning predicted. `json`'s `walk` reads a nullable child, null-tests it and **calls
`walk` on it** — which reads exactly like the case rule 2 exists for, and an argument was made
mid-analysis that the null-test extension therefore would not help it. Wrong: the retain and the
call land in *different blocks*, so the retain is lost at the block boundary before rule 2 is ever
consulted. **Scope rule 1 fires first and hides rule 2 completely.**

The practical consequence is worth more than the number: **interprocedural analysis is not needed.**
It is the expensive fix, it was the one the shape suggested, and it would have bought nothing —
because no pending retain in any of these programs ever survives long enough to meet a `Call`.

What the three counts mean for planning:

- **blockLimited (16 of 19 on `json`)** — the cross-block/null-test extension. This is the whole
  gate-relevant term.
- **releaseLimited (3 of 19)** — ADR-0063's surviving-`Release` rule, the correctness fix. Recovering
  these needs a way to express a return value's **uniqueness**: escalation 0011, spec §3, rule 4.
- **opaqueLimited (0)** — nothing to do.

### The 16 is NOT a forecast of 16 elided pairs, and must not be quoted as one

`blockLimited` counts retains that died **at a block boundary**. It does not follow that a
cross-block fix converts them into elided pairs, because **a retain that survives the boundary then
faces rule 2**, and rule 2 is real: isolated properly — `Retain`, `Call`, `Release` all in one block
with no `if` to split it — a `Call` invalidates, `opaqueLimited=1`.

So a cross-block extension **moves** some fraction of `blockLimited` into `opaqueLimited` rather than
into `elided`. Every function in `json` calls something (`peek`, `walk`, `parseValue`), so how much
of the 16 survives to be elided is **not determined by any measurement taken so far** — it can only
be known by building the extension and re-running `--why`.

The honest planning statement is therefore narrower than the table suggests:

- **Upper bound on what a cross-block fix can recover on `json`: 16 of 19.**
- **Lower bound: unknown, possibly small.**
- `opaqueLimited=0` today means only that no retain currently *reaches* a `Call` — **not** that calls
  are harmless. It is a measurement of where execution stops first, and removing the first obstacle
  does not prove the second one is absent.

This is the same reading error the count was built to prevent, one level up: a real measurement, of
the wrong quantity, pointing the encouraging way. Recorded before either the fix or a forecast was
built on it.

**A caution on reading `--why`: the counts are attempts, not distinct pairs.** A retain invalidated
in one block and re-attempted is counted once per attempt, so the totals exceed the retain count and
should be read as proportions rather than as a census.

### RESULT: the cross-block extension was built, is correct, and recovers ZERO on real programs

Built and landed (`_elideCrossBlock`). Verified safe — 15/15 dc-elide unit tests, 41/41 conformance —
and it demonstrably fires: the canonical null-test shape (`final t = n.next; if (t != null) {...}
return total;`) goes from 1 retain to 0.

**On `json`, `tree-traversal` and `m2-list` it removes nothing at all.** Two distinct reasons, both
measured rather than reasoned:

| function | retains | returns | back edges | why it does not elide |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `json/parseNumber` | 6 | 3 | 1 | multi-return **and** loop — fails conditions 1 and 2 |
| `json/parseString` | 4 | 2 | 1 | same |
| `json/parseArray` | 7 | 2 | 2 | same |
| **`json/walk`** | **2** | **1** | **0** | **qualifies, then blocked by a `Call`** |
| `tree-traversal/build` | 4 | 2 | 0 | multi-return |
| **`tree-traversal/walk`** | **2** | **1** | **0** | **qualifies, then blocked by a `Call`** |

**The second row type is the important one.** `walk` in both benchmarks satisfies the structural
conditions — one return, no loops — so the block boundary is no longer what stops it. What stops it
is `walk(f)` sitting between the retain and the release. **That is the `blockLimited → opaqueLimited`
conversion this entry warned about, now observed instead of predicted.**

So the conclusion recorded above is confirmed in the sharpest possible way:

> **Interprocedural analysis is not ruled out; it was unreached.** It is now reached, and it is the
> binding constraint on the only functions whose structure the cross-block pass can handle.

**What each fix is actually worth, measured:**

- **Cross-block/null-test extension: zero on current programs.** Correct engineering, verified, and
  it bought nothing. Kept, because it is the instrument that produced this answer and because the
  functions it handles will appear as code is written — but it must not be quoted as a gate
  improvement, because it is not one.
- **Post-dominance (handling loops and multiple returns): unmeasured.** It would let the pass reach
  `parseNumber`/`parseString`/`parseArray`, which hold 17 of `json`'s 19 retains — but those are also
  full of `peek(p)` calls, so it would very likely surface the same `Call` wall one layer down.
- **Interprocedural analysis, or an ownership convention saying what a callee may do with a borrowed
  reference: now the load-bearing one.** The ARC ownership carrier the owner ratified is the vehicle
  for the second option.

**Cost of the workaround:** none. The gate's dominant term is now attributed to a specific, named
constraint rather than to "ARC is expensive", and the two cheaper fixes have been priced at zero and
probably-zero respectively — which is worth more than either would have been if it had worked.

**Next step:** extend pass 3 across the null test — a retain and its release separated only by a
branch on the retained value's nullness is the canonical shape and is worth handling before any
general cross-block analysis.

**CORRECTION (2026-08-26).** An earlier revision of this entry said pass 3's *surrender* count
"measures zero", and drew the conclusion that the GAP-0054 correctness fix was therefore free. **Both
halves were wrong.** The zero was measured on `hashmap`, which is on an unmerged branch and is not
this tree — so the number never applied to the code the fix landed in. Measured properly on `json`
by two interleaved A/B runs, 600 samples per side: the correctness fix costs **+4.2% to +4.5%**
against a ±2% noise floor. It is a **trade**, not a free win. `dc-sys-21` caught and reported their
own error here; recorded because the shape recurs — **a real measurement, quoted about a thing it
did not measure**, which is the same failure as the container conformance number and the `mapfile`
PATH masking, arrived at by two different people on the same day while both were actively looking
for it.

The conclusion still holds — a wrong answer is not a performance characteristic — but it must be
argued as a trade rather than as costless. Recovering the 4% needs a way to express a return value's
**uniqueness**, which DCDart's ARC conventions cannot say: escalation 0011.

### RESOLUTION (2026-08-27, ADR-0066): the blockLimited and opaqueLimited walls are down; what is left is releaseLimited plus loops

Three rules landed in `dc-elide` (ADR-0066: refcount-transparent callees, multi-exit frontier
pairs, null-ARC-op removal). The prediction chain above resolved as follows, measured:

- **"Interprocedural analysis is now the load-bearing one" — confirmed, and it was buildable
  without an ownership convention.** The "borrows-only" summary (every release covered per-ValueId,
  transitively, badness as call-graph reachability) proves `walk`/`tlookup`/`chainSum`/`valueSum`
  transparent, including through their own recursion. No spec change, no annotation: computed from
  the IR.
- **"The blockLimited → opaqueLimited conversion" — it happened and then the second wall fell
  too.** The frontier pass handles the multi-return shape that stopped the ADR-0025 cross-block
  extension, and the transparency summary handles the call it then runs into. `walk` in both
  benchmarks: 2 retains → 0.
- **The retain population nobody had named: `Retain <NullRef>`.** `parseNumber`'s 6 retains and
  `parseString`'s 4 are ALL null-field-initializer retains, defined no-ops under ADR-0049, now
  deleted (rule N). 13 of `json`'s 19 lowered retains and 13 of `hashmap`'s 35 are this.

New counts (`bench/elision-delta.sh`, lowered → surviving): `json` **19 → 4**, `tree-traversal`
**6 → 0**, `hashmap` **35 → 13**, `m2-list` 12 → 6; whole tree 133 → 42 (68.4%). `hashmap`'s entire
lookup path (~12 executed pairs per map operation) is retain-free; what survives is `tinsert`/
`tremove`/`unlinkFrom` (GAP-0067: their callees genuinely release old field values) and
`parseArray`'s tail-append (GAP-0066, releaseLimited, unchanged).

**Still open, now precisely bounded:** loops (rule F refuses any back edge — NEON's
`loaderNextBatch` is the live case, GAP-0067), and everything releaseLimited (GAP-0066 /
escalation 0011). This entry stays OPEN for those two; the intra-block/cross-block/call-opacity
walls it was opened for are closed.

## GAP-0063 — floating point landed (ADR-0065) minus five things, each deliberate, one with a workaround already in use

**Development update (ADR-0083):** all signed/unsigned sized integer and float
conversion directions are implemented. Signed conversion uses sitofp and
fptosi.sat, and source tests cover fractions, extrema, infinities and NaN.
Platform verification is pending; remaining floating-point requirements below
are not closed by this conversion work.


**Filed:** 2026-08-27, the same unit of work as ADR-0065 — recorded now so the next float user
(NEON's kernels) finds the walls before hitting them.

f32/f64 arithmetic, comparisons, conversions, literals and `Pointer<f32>`/`Pointer<f64>` buffers
all work (`tests/conformance/float-arith/`, `float-pointer/`). What was left out, and what each
costs:

1. **Transcendentals: no `sqrt`/`exp`/`log`/`pow`.** Softmax and layernorm need `exp` and `sqrt`.
   Deliberately not instructions and not prelude members: on many inputs LLVM's own intrinsics
   lower to **libcalls**, which are undefined symbols in a `@bare` object — CLAUDE.md rule 1 by
   accident. The intended routes are `@extern` C math (hosted targets) or polynomial/Newton kernels
   in DCDart itself (bare targets). Cost: every ML kernel beyond dot/matmul writes or imports its
   own approximation until someone designs the audited-intrinsic story.
2. **No SIMD.** -O2 may auto-vectorize the accumulation loops (that is fine and free); there is no
   vector *type* and no way to ask for one. Cost: kernels leave lane-level performance on the table
   until a real design exists — do not fake it with `@extern` assembly in the meantime.
3. **`Pointer<T>` is not lowerable in `@bare` function signatures** (pre-existing, but floats make
   it visible: a kernel's natural signature is `dotF32(Pointer<f32> a, ...)`). Workaround, already
   the repo idiom and used by `m4-float-dot`: pass `u64` addresses, wrap with
   `Pointer<T>.fromAddress` at the use site. Cost: signatures lie slightly (an address is not a
   typed pointer), and every caller restates the element stride by hand — GAP-0051's `.elementAt`
   wart, now at two widths.
4. **No float `@rodata` tables.** `_rodataElementType` still accepts `List<u8|u16|u32|u64|Ref>`
   only, so constant weight tables cannot be emitted as f32 data yet. Workaround: emit the IEEE bit
   patterns as `List<u32>` and read through `Pointer<f32>` at the same address. Cost: unreadable
   initializers; closing it is a small, mechanical extension of ADR-0040's element-type switch.
5. **f32/f64 literal ergonomics: constructor-wrapped only.** `f32(0.1)` / `f64(1.5)` work (one
   rounding, exact bits — ADR-0065 §4); a bare `1.5` in float context does not, and float constant
   expressions (`f64(0.5 * 3.0)`) are not folded — `_tryFoldConstDouble` handles literals and
   CFE-evaluated constants only, because folding has a host-rounding-order question best decided
   against a real case. Cost: noise at every constant, same as `u64(1)`'s — fixed by the same
   future CFE fork, not separately.

Also NOT done, recorded as fact rather than gap: `Result` payloads stay u64-only, and the signed
paths (`sitofp`/`fptosi.sat`) are refused by name in the backend, GAP-0024-style, until signed
sized ints exist.

## GAP-0064 — only one DCDart object per link may allocate

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED IN DEVELOPMENT — platform verification pending.

ADR-0082 adds separate heap runtime emission. Build one client with
`--emit-heap-runtime runtime.o`, the others with `--external-heap-runtime`, then
link all clients with exactly one runtime object. Default single-object builds
still embed their own state. Clients share the arena, free lists and live count;
cross-object allocation/free is exercised for 2,000 cycles. A layout-specific
relocation makes incompatible region sizes fail at link time. The native source
regression runs with each packaged compiler, including Windows. Allocator thread
safety remains a separate concurrency requirement.

## GAP-0068 — dcc never emits fused multiply-add; C compiled with the harness flags does by default

**Filed:** 2026-08-27, from NEON N2's float benchmarks (`bench/benchmarks/attention-f32`), where it
surfaced as a checksum mismatch, not a slowdown.

dcc lowers every float `a * b + c` to separate `fmul` + `fadd` — two roundings, strict per-op IEEE.
clang's default for C is `-ffp-contract=on`: the same expression contracts to `llvm.fmuladd` and one
fused `fmadd`/`fmla` instruction — ONE rounding. Two consequences, one per direction:

1. **Cross-language bit-equality breaks by default.** attention-f32's softmax polynomial differed
   from its statement-identical C twin by 1–2 ulp until the C side was pinned with
   `#pragma STDC FP_CONTRACT OFF` (the harness's flag list is fixed and shared, so the C11 pragma is
   the only per-benchmark route). Any future oracle or baseline that memcmp's DCDart floats against
   C must either pin contraction off or construct inputs whose arithmetic is exact (matmul-f32's
   trick — inputs on a 2^-6 grid keep every intermediate exact, so fused and unfused agree).
2. **DCDart leaves FMA throughput and accuracy on the table.** On FMA hardware the contracted loop
   is up to 2x the flops at strictly better accuracy. Today this is invisible behind GAP-0034
   (volatile pointer accesses already block vectorization and most scheduling); it becomes the
   next visible cost the day GAP-0034 closes, and it should be re-measured then.
   *(2026-08-27 update: GAP-0034 closed — ADR-0069 — and the float ratio did not move, because
   GAP-0070's trapping address arithmetic was the actual front of the queue. FMA is part of
   GAP-0070's measured 2.42x post-trap residual and stays behind it, still OPEN, still
   deliberately untouched by ADR-0069's unit.)*

Not a bug: ADR-0065 chose strict IEEE per-op semantics and unfused is the letter of that choice —
reproducible bits across targets is worth real money to NEON's oracle discipline. But it is an
UNDECIDED choice, decided today by emission accident rather than by ADR. Deciding it (forbid
contraction forever and say so; or add an opt-in fused form, e.g. a `fma()` prelude intrinsic — NOT
blanket `-ffp-contract`-style contraction, which would un-reproduce every existing checksum) is
spec §4.1-adjacent and rule-4-frozen after M3, so it should be decided before M3, not after.

## GAP-0075 — `@bare` floating point is unavailable by default, and the escape hatch is unsafe by design

**Domain:** backend, dcc (ADR-0071)
**Status:** OPEN — deliberate, and the honest cost of ADR-0071

Freestanding targets pass `-mgeneral-regs-only`, so `@bare` code cannot use floating point unless it
passes `--allow-fp`. On x86-64 a float means an xmm register, and there is no way to have one without
the other.

**Why the restriction exists** is ADR-0071: LLVM vectorises ordinary integer loops into
`xorps`/`movaps`, putting SSE into `@bare` objects that contain no floating point at all, which
silently broke a downstream kernel that defers saving FPU state.

**What is still wrong after the fix:** `--allow-fp` makes `@bare` FP *deliberate*, not *safe*. A
program that passes it and runs inside a kernel deferring FPU save is still incorrect — the flag
moves the decision from the optimizer to the author, which is the most a compiler flag can do.

**Cost of the workaround:** any `@bare` numeric code wanting real floats must either pass the flag
and accept an unstated obligation, or accept soft-float — which the spine check rejects outright,
since the libcalls are undefined symbols and the allowlist is deliberately not grown for them.

**Next step:** spec §6's `@interrupt` and FPU-state discipline. The compiler needs to know which
functions may run with an unsaved FPU state and refuse FP in those specifically, rather than refusing
FP for the whole target. That is a language question, not a flag.

## GAP-0073 — LLVM loop-idiom recognition turns a `@bare` store loop into a `memset` LIBCALL on freestanding targets

**Domain:** backend (freestanding targets)
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-09-13) — freestanding functions carry LLVM no-builtins; no-libcalls conformance verifies zero/copy loops on x86-64 and ARM64 without adding libc to the allowlist.

A plain `@bare` zeroing loop written with `elementAt` (ADR-0070) compiles, at `--target
bare-x86_64 --allow-fp`, into a call to `memset` — an undefined symbol, so
`verify-freestanding.sh` fails on an object whose SOURCE contains no call at all. Rule 1 leak,
emitted by the optimizer rather than the user. Minimal repro (fails `nm -u` with `U memset`):

```dart
@bare
void zeroBuf(u64 addr, u64 n) {
  final p = Pointer<f32>.fromAddress(addr);
  var i = u64(0);
  while (i < n) {
    p.elementAt(i).value = f32(0.0);
    i = i + u64(1);
  }
}
```

The old `fromAddress(base + i*width)` idiom never surfaced this: its per-element trap chains and
inttoptr blocked the loop-idiom pass — which means ADR-0070's addressing win EXPOSES the gap
everywhere a migrated kernel zeroes or copies a buffer (LLVM's loop-idiom pass will equally emit
`memcpy` for a copy loop). Same family as ADR-0071's `-mgeneral-regs-only` finding: the optimizer
inserting environment assumptions into freestanding objects.

**Workaround** (used by `neon/native/matmul.dart`): restructure so no pure store/copy loop exists —
e.g. peel the first accumulation iteration to write the initial product instead of zeroing. Cost:
contortion of straightforward code, and every future freestanding kernel author rediscovers the
wall at `verify-freestanding.sh` time, after the code looked done.

**Fix direction:** freestanding targets should either disable loop-idiom libcall emission
(`-fno-builtin` equivalent: TargetLibraryInfo with no available libcalls), or provide DCDart's own
`memset`/`memcpy` in the runtime and allowlist them — the first is the one that matches rule 1's
letter. Decide by ADR; do not grow the allowlist silently.

## GAP-0074 — a fresh heap return passed DIRECTLY as a constructor argument leaks one reference

**Domain:** dcc-lower (ARC insertion)
**Status:** RESOLVED (2026-09-13) — constructor temporaries are released after all field references are retained; nested/shared-field cases have runtime and pre/post-elision assertions.

Passing a heap-returning call's result straight into a constructor leaks the temporary: the
callee's +1 (fresh return) is retained again by the constructor's field initialization and no
release of the temporary is ever emitted. Binding the same value to a local first is clean — the
scope-end release of the local balances the books. Minimal repro (C driver observes
`dc_heap_live`):

```dart
class Inner extends HeapObject { u64 v; Inner(this.v); }
class Outer extends HeapObject { Inner inner; Outer(this.inner); }

@bare Inner makeInner(u64 v) => Inner(v);
@bare Outer makeDirect(u64 v) => Outer(makeInner(v));   // LEAKS the Inner: live=1 after drop
@bare Outer makeViaLocal(u64 v) {                        // clean: live=0 after drop
  final i = makeInner(v);
  return Outer(i);
}
@bare void drop(@owned Outer o) {}
```

Same family as GAP-0060/the void-release bug (a release path missed for one syntactic shape),
and invisible to every existing conformance target because they all bind before constructing.
Surfaced immediately by N3's `Var(tensorNew2d(r, c), null)` — the gradcheck harness's
per-case `dc_heap_live == 0` assert caught it as exactly one leaked Tensor per Var.

**Cost of the workaround:** every construction site must remember to bind call results to
locals first; nothing diagnoses the direct form, so each new author pays one leak-hunt.
Needs a conformance target with the pair above (leak check + DC-IR release-count assertion)
alongside the fix.


## GAP-0076 — Error propagation skipped owned locals and unfinished-expression owners

**Domain:** dcc-lower, ARC
**Status:** FIXED in v0.1.3 — regression added, ADR-0075

`Result.propagate()` emitted a direct error return without the cleanup used by an
explicit return. It now releases heap/weak locals and owned parameters on the error
path. Enclosing expressions track acquired argument/receiver references until their
consumer executes; an early error releases those too, including retains acquired for
an `@owned` argument whose call has not happened yet. Constructor allocation occurs
after argument evaluation, avoiding destruction of a partially initialized object.

`tests/conformance/propagate-ownership` checks 3,000 iterations of success/error paths
through direct/local/indirect calls, constructors, methods and field assignment, with
zero live objects after each call. Raw/elided ARC counts retain both exit cleanups.


## GAP-0077 — Raw and packed loads/stores implicitly promised natural alignment

**Domain:** backend
**Status:** FIXED in v0.1.3 — backend regression added

LLVM interprets an omitted load/store alignment as ABI alignment. Ordinary and
volatile pointers can address arbitrary bytes, and packed fields deliberately
occupy unaligned offsets. Their loads/stores now explicitly use `align 1`;
LLVM may strengthen that only when it proves better alignment. Atomic operations
retain natural alignment after their explicit runtime guard. Backend tests failed
before the fix; the existing packed-struct conformance exercises real byte layout.
This does not make arbitrary MMIO access widths safe for every device.


## GAP-0078 — Windows x64 Result C ABI returned the wrong value

**Domain:** backend, C ABI
**Status:** FIXED in v0.1.3; native Windows packaged-compiler CI passed

Expanding the packaged Windows compiler test to Result propagation reproduced a
wrong payload with zero live objects. LLVM aggregate returns alone do not implement
the source-language C ABI: Windows x64 uses a caller-provided return buffer for a
16-byte structure and pointer arguments for those aggregates.

Definitions, external declarations, direct/indirect calls, parameter entry loads
and returns now agree on that convention. Scratch slots are allocated in function
entry blocks, avoiding stack growth when a call occurs in a loop. Other targets
retain their existing convention. Supported Windows aggregate layouts are the
current two-word Result/Str forms; other layouts fail explicitly until classified.
The regression includes C-to-DCDart and DCDart-to-C aggregate arguments/returns,
plus a call through a function pointer.


## GAP-0079 — oversized integer shift counts produced LLVM poison

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED IN DEVELOPMENT — platform verification pending.

ADR-0085 defines large-count zero/sign fill and negative-count traps. Previously
unvalidated counts reached LLVM shift instructions, whose oversized-count result
is poison. A source boundary regression failed before the fix and now passes
for all integer widths. The packaged-compiler regression checks runtime results
and negative-count traps on each release host.
