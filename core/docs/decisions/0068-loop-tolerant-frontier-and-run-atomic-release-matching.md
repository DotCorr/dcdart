# ADR-0068: loop-tolerant rule F, and run-atomic release matching (the emission-order study's answer)

**Status:** decided, implemented, verified. Same categorical position as ADR-0063/0066: `dcc-lower`
emits byte-identical DC-IR (a lowering change was tried, measured, and REVERTED — §2); only which
provably-redundant operations `dc-elide` deletes changes. NOT a rule-4 memory-model change; the one
observability question it raises (destructor-cascade order inside a release run) is answered in §2's
safety argument. Addresses GAP-0067 item 2 (loops) and part of GAP-0066's releaseLimited population;
GAP-0067 item 1 (mutating callees) untouched — it waits on escalation 0011, per the assignment.

Numbered 0068 because 0067 was claimed by a concurrent unit
(`0067-closure-heavy-benchmark-explicit-environments.md`) while this one was in flight.

## Context

ADR-0066 left two ranked limiters (GAP-0067) plus GAP-0066's releaseLimited pairs. This unit took
the two that need no spec decision:

- **Rule F refused any function containing a back edge.** The live cost was NEON `tensor.dart`'s
  `loaderNextBatch`: `Retain loader.data` in the entry block, `Release` in the single exit, two
  ARC-free copy loops between — refusal purely structural (`blockLimited=1` under `--why`).
- **GAP-0066 named a `_releaseHeapLocals` emission-order study** as the analysis-free route to
  `epochReduce`'s releaseLimited pair: `Retain t; tensorDestroy(t)@owned; Release s2; Release s1;
  Release t` — releasing `t` FIRST would let ADR-0031's consumed-argument rule cancel the pair.

## 1. Rule F, loop-tolerant (supersedes ADR-0066's whole-function back-edge refusal)

Condition 1 ("no back edges anywhere") is replaced by: **the retain's block and every frontier
block must lie on no CFG cycle** (a block can execute twice per call iff it is reachable from
itself). Blocks BETWEEN the pair may lie on cycles. Machinery updated to match: dominators by the
standard iterative fixpoint (valid on cyclic CFGs; the old single forward sweep relied on the DAG's
topological order), and condition 4's frontier-disjointness reachability was already cycle-safe.

**Safety argument, delta only.** The retain executes ≤1× per call (its block is on no cycle);
likewise each frontier release. Condition 3 (dominance) still makes every frontier execution follow
the retain; condition 2's walk still stops each path at its first unclaimed `Release v` and — the
load-bearing point — **fully scans every block it can reach, interior loop bodies included**, so a
loop body containing any release, any opaque op, or a `Retain v` fails the candidate. What executes
N times inside the interval is therefore provably refcount-irrelevant. A path that enters an
interior loop and never leaves performs no decrement and never reaches a `Return`. ADR-0063's gap
invariant holds per completing path, unchanged.

**Deliberately still refused:** retain and release both inside one iteration body (the pair
completing before the back edge). That needs an alternation argument this pass does not make, and
the one live instance (`parseArray`'s `Retain tail`) is independently blocked by an aliasing
field-store release inside its interval — nothing measured would be recovered.

**Tests:** the ADR-0066 negative test for this exact shape is INVERTED with an in-place
justification (it is now the acceptance test, `crossBlockElided=1`); new negatives pin the retain-
in-loop (cross-iteration escape), release-in-loop, and loop-carried-alias (surviving foreign
release inside the interior loop) refusals.

## 2. The emission-order study, and where it actually landed

**Hypothesis confirmed, mechanism-wise:** with one-at-a-time processing, emission order among an
exit's releases decides elision — a surviving `Release a` one slot before a pending pair's
`Release b` kills the pair; the opposite order cancels it. Same multiset, one executed pair of
difference.

**The dcc-lower fix was tried and rejected on its numbers.** `_releaseHeapLocals` /
`_releaseScopeFrom` were changed to emit most-recently-used-first (the local most likely to carry
the pending retain). Measured: `epochReduce`'s pair cancelled (hypothesis's acceptance case) — and
`m2-heap-field`'s previously-elided pair UN-cancelled, because there the pending retain (a
field-store retain on `b`) is on the *less* recently used local (`holder` is read after the store).
Declaration order fixes one case, last-use order the other; **no static order dominates.** Reverted
to byte-identical lowering.

**Adopted instead: run-atomic matching in `_elideBlock`.** A maximal run of CONSECUTIVE `Release`
instructions is processed as one unit: first every pending retain whose matching release sits
anywhere in the run cancels; then the survivors (original order — the emitted sequence never
changes) invalidate whatever is still pending. This makes the per-block pass order-independent
across a run, which strictly dominates every emission-order choice dcc-lower could make — and it
lives in the pass, so it is checked against literal adjacency in the block body rather than against
a lowering convention asserted in another file (exactly the dependence ADR-0063 complained about
when GAP-0054's safety hung on `_releaseHeapLocals` placement).

**Safety argument** *(corrected 2026-08-27 by a peer audit: the original text justified the
reorder with "releases are pure decrements, decrements commute" — that sentence is FALSE. A
`Release` that hits zero runs a destructor cascade, so arbitrary compiler-emitted code executes
between "adjacent" releases and the instruction sequences do not commute. The conclusion was
verified sound; the premise below is the one that actually carries it).* Equivalent to reordering
adjacent releases until the matched one is first, then applying the unchanged one-at-a-time rule.
The reorder is sound on two facts:

1. **End-of-run counts are order-independent** — destructor cascades included (induction over the
   acyclic ownership graph: an object's total decrement is its explicit releases plus one per dying
   holder, and dying is determined by order-independent totals; a strong cycle reaches zero under
   neither order). So an object is freed by the run iff the original order freed it.
2. **An earlier death inside the run is unobservable, because no use follows it** before the two
   orders reconverge at run end. Adjacency's actual role is guaranteeing **no use is interleaved**
   — between the two candidate free sites only releases and their cascades execute — and by fact 1
   any use AFTER the run of an object the run kills was already a use-after-free in the original
   program. Adjacency is the checkable conservative proxy for this no-use-follows premise: under
   it the premise holds a fortiori, since nothing at all stands between the releases. A future
   widening that admits non-ARC instructions into a run would have to check the premise itself
   rather than lean on the proxy.

**Destructor premise, stated as the trigger condition:** fact 2 additionally requires that nothing
running *inside* the run can observe the object — sound while synthesized destructors contain only
field releases (ADR-0022); a destructor that could `WeakLoad` the affected object (e.g. future
user-defined destructors, spec §3) would make death time observable from within the run and
invalidates this rule.

For the cancelled pair, the interval up to the run is decrement-free exactly as
before (anything surviving there would have cleared the pending), and inside the run the
transformed count sits exactly one below the original's, both ending equal.

**What order CAN move — and why it is not observable.** Which release site zeroes a shared count,
hence destructor-cascade order within the run, hence heap-slot reuse order. Every DCDart destructor
is compiler-synthesized (`_buildDestructor`, ADR-0022 — field releases only, never user code), and
a managed object's address is not exposed to programs in either direction (GAP-0061; `PtrToInt` is
emitted only for raw `Pointer`/`Str` values). No conforming program can read the difference. Had
user-defined destructors existed, this half of the unit would have stopped at an escalation instead
— that check was made first, not after.

## What it does — measured

`bench/elision-delta.sh` (retains lowered → surviving), before → after, same tree (baseline is
ADR-0066's state plus concurrent unrelated work; tree total reads 146 pre, not 133, for that
reason):

| target | before | after | what moved |
|---|---|---|---|
| `json` | 19 → 4 | 19 → **3** | `parseArray`'s tail-append pair (GAP-0066's headline case) — run-atomic |
| `m3-generic-class` | 2 → 1 | 2 → **0** | `boxNode`'s `got` pair — run-atomic; justification re-pinned in its conformance harness |
| `m3-elide-alias` | 7 → 3 | 7 → **2** | `releaseThroughDestructor` — run-atomic; **`aliasBug`/`aliasBugNullable` byte-for-byte unchanged, still refused** |
| `hashmap` / `hashmap-burst` | 35 → 13 | unchanged | every survivor is GAP-0067 item 1 (mutating callees) — out of scope by assignment |
| `m2-loopheap` | 2 → 1 | unchanged | `lastKept`'s releases are separated by the loop counter's `IAdd`: no run, still GAP-0066 |
| everything else | — | unchanged | tree-wide diff is exactly these rows |
| **total across tree** | 146 → 46 | 146 → **43** | |

NEON `tensor.dart` (the assignment's two acceptance cases, `dc-objdump --arc --why`):

| function | before | after | rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `loaderNextBatch` | retain 1 (blockLimited) | **0** (`crossBlock=1`) | §1 loop-tolerant rule F |
| `epochReduce` | retain 1 (releaseLimited) | **0** (`elided=1`) | §2 run-atomic (consumed-argument pair) |
| `tensorSlice0` / `loaderNew` / `tensorDestroyViaBase` | 2 / 1 / 1 | unchanged | blockLimited/releaseLimited across real branches and field stores — GAP-0066 family |

Dynamic effect on NEON's epoch: both cancelled pairs execute once per batch — 469 retain/release
pairs per epoch each, now gone. `neon/native/build.sh` fully green after: N0 + tensor-path oracles
300/300 + 300/300, view semantics, epoch over MNIST-60k with `dc_heap_live == 0` at exit, matmul
freestanding-green.

## Verification

- `dc-elide` unit tests: 32 (28 before): the inverted loop test + three loop negatives (§1), the
  inverted adjacency test + the use-between-the-releases negative (§2); all passing.
- Conformance: 46/46. Exactly three count assertions re-pinned, each with an in-place justification
  that answers the stop-the-line warning the old pin carried (`generic-class` `boxNode`,
  `elide-alias` `releaseThroughDestructor` + its TOTAL). The behavior (VALUE) assertions those
  harnesses exist for — 110-not-198 — pass unchanged, and the two genuine miscompilation shapes
  still pin retain=1.
- Leak discipline: every conformance target and NEON's per-case + epoch checks end
  `dc_heap_live == 0`.
- Benchmarks: hashmap/json/tree-traversal medians in the unit report; hashmap and tree-traversal
  object files are expected-identical (their counts did not move), json is the only one whose code
  changed.
