// core/dc-ir/instructions.dart
//
// The DC-IR instruction vocabulary. Started deliberately small (exactly
// what M0's `add(u64, u64) => a + b` needed), plus the ARC node shapes
// (Retain/Release) whose *shape* CLAUDE.md rule 4 wants frozen before M2
// starts writing an inserter against them. M1 added raw memory access
// (Load/Store/IntToPtr, spec §6 `Pointer<T>`) — see the section below.
//
// M1 also added ICmp (integer comparison, spec §5's `Result<T,E>`/`?`
// propagation needs a DCBool to branch on) — see the section below and
// docs/decisions/0013-icmp.md.
//
// SCOPE CUT — what is still NOT here, on purpose: struct field access
// (handled entirely in dcc-lower via existing instructions, see
// docs/decisions/0011), calls, allocation, `weak`/`unowned` reads, casts
// (`.toU32()`), bit ops (`& | ^ ~ << >> >>>`), `@volatile` semantics,
// pointer arithmetic (`.elementAt`). Add each when a real conformance
// target needs it, not speculatively; this file's existing shapes
// (dest/lhs/rhs typed via DCValue, sealed hierarchy, Overflow as its own
// enum rather than a bool) are the pattern to repeat. Float arithmetic
// and comparisons (FAdd..FCmp below) were on this list until NEON's ML
// kernels became the real consumer (ADR-0065).
