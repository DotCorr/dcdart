# core/bench/elision-delta.sh — how much does ADR-0025's pass 3 actually remove?
#
#   bash core/bench/elision-delta.sh [file.dart ...]
#
# With no arguments it reports every benchmark and every example that
# allocates.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `elideRedundantRetainReleasePairs` runs inside
# `lowerToDCModule`, so `dc-objdump --arc` reported only what SURVIVED it. The
# pass's unit tests prove THE PASS FIRES. Nothing proved HOW MUCH IT REMOVES
# ON A REAL PROGRAM, and only the second question decides whether an ARC
# benchmark is measuring ARC or measuring a missing optimisation (GAP-0062).
#
# Measured on 2026-08-26, before any fix:
#
#     tree-traversal    6 retains ->  4    removed 2  (33%)
#     json             19 retains -> 18    removed 1  ( 5%)
#     string-pass       0 retains ->  0    nothing to remove
#
# The cause is structural: pass 3 is intra-block and every nullable heap field
# read ends its block at the null test, so on linked structures the pass is
# looking at a program chopped into pieces smaller than the pairs it is trying
# to match.
#
# THIS IS THE ACCEPTANCE CRITERION for the null-test extension. A fix that
# works moves `json`'s survivors substantially below 18. A fix that moves
# nothing means the hypothesis was wrong, which is worth knowing before
# general cross-block dataflow gets built on top of it.
#
# 2026-08-27, ADR-0066 (transparent callees + frontier pairs + null ARC ops):
#
#     hashmap          35 retains -> 13    (lookup path fully retain-free)
#     json             19 retains ->  4
#     tree-traversal    6 retains ->  0
#     whole tree      133 retains -> 42
#
# What survives is attributed in GAP-0066 (releaseLimited) and GAP-0067
# (mutating callees, loops) -- not unmeasured.
#
# 2026-08-27, ADR-0068 (loop-tolerant rule F + run-atomic release matching):
#
#     json             19 retains ->  3    (parseArray's tail-append pair)
#     m3-generic-class  2 retains ->  0
#     m3-elide-alias    7 retains ->  2    (aliasBug/aliasBugNullable unchanged)
#     whole tree      146 -> 43           (146 pre includes concurrent targets)
#
# hashmap unchanged on purpose: all 13 survivors are GAP-0067 item 1
# (mutating callees, escalation 0011's question). NEON's loaderNextBatch
# and epochReduce (not in this tree's list) both went retain-free.
#
# 2026-08-27, ADR-0072 (derived return-value freshness, escalation 0011
# Option C — owner-decided):
#
#     m2-loopheap       2 retains ->  0    (lastKept: ADR-0063's third named
#                                           lost pair, spared across the
#                                           foreign release, freshSpared=1)
#     fresh-return      4 retains ->  2    (new pinned fixture: freshShape
#                                           recovered, nonFreshShape refused)
#     whole tree      194 -> 56           (194 pre includes concurrent
#                                           targets; was -> 57)
#
# Everything else BYTE-IDENTICAL on purpose, and the unchanged rows are the
# honest half of the result: json's remaining 3 are loop-carried pairs
# (GAP-0067 item 2's leftover shape — the summary proves parseValue & co.
# returns-fresh, the loop shape is what stands); hashmap's 13 are mutating-
# callee descents, store-retains with no matching release, and cluster-
# escaping mapInsert values (per-site table in ADR-0072); m3-elide-alias's
# aliasBug/aliasBugNullable stay refused because a Load is never fresh.
#
# It is NOT sufficient on its own. Seeing the pairs and removing them is one
# thing; that removal paying for itself is another. Pair this with
# `closure-heavy`'s ratio, which is the allocator-honest benchmark closest to
# the bar and almost entirely `cur = cur.next` alias traffic.
