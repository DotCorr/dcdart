/* core/bench/harness/bench_main.c
 *
 * The timing driver. ONE file, linked identically against the DCDart object
 * and against the C object, so that whatever it costs, it costs both sides
 * the same amount.
 *
 * Contract with a benchmark: it exports exactly
 *
 *     uint64_t benchKernel(uint64_t arg);
 *
 * with C linkage, in its own translation unit. The DCDart side gets that for
 * free (a `@bare` function IS a C-ABI symbol). The C side must therefore also
 * live in its own .o and be linked, NOT #included -- see run-bench.sh. That is
 * not a stylistic choice: if the C kernel were in the same TU as this driver,
 * clang would inline it and constant-fold across the call, and DCDart, which
 * physically cannot be inlined into this file, would be racing a competitor
 * that had deleted the race. No -flto, for the same reason.
 *
 * Protocol (stdout, one key per line, parsed by run-bench.sh):
 *
 *     CHECKSUM <decimal>     the kernel's result, so every implementation of
 *                            a benchmark can be proved to compute the same
 *                            thing before any of their times are compared
 *     SAMPLE_NS <decimal>    one timed iteration
 *
 * Every process run performs ONE warmup iteration whose time is discarded,
 * then the requested number of timed iterations. run-bench.sh additionally
 * discards the whole FIRST process run of every configuration, so cold dyld,
 * cold page cache and first-touch faults land outside every reported number.

/* LEAK CHECK. `dc_heap_live` is DCDart's live-object count (ADR-0058); it is
 * incremented by every allocation and decremented when a block returns to a
 * free list. It exists only in objects emitted by dcc, so it is declared WEAK
 * and the check is skipped when this driver is linked into a C baseline,
 * where the symbol is absent and its address is null.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL. A leaking DCDart kernel does LESS WORK than a
 * correct one -- it never runs the free path -- so a leak makes the benchmark
 * FASTER and the ratio better. Without this check, the single most likely way
 * to accidentally publish a flattering M3 number is to leak, and nothing in
 * the harness would have noticed: the checksum still matches, the run still
 * completes, and the number is simply wrong in DCDart's favour.
 *
 * Checked AFTER the timed region so it costs nothing in the measurement, and
 * reported as a line the runner can refuse on rather than as a silent exit. */
