BENCH_NOTE="NOT one of M3's five (not in M3_REQUIRED) and enters no gate mean.
NEON N2 CANDIDATE 2 of 2 (neon/ROADMAP.md N2): S = QK^T/sqrt(d), row softmax,
xV -- offered to the gate suite; DCDart's call whether it enters. d is fixed
at 64 so the scale is exactly 0.125 and no sqrt exists anywhere.

EXP IS THE SAME POLYNOMIAL ON BOTH SIDES, NOT LIBM. DCDart ships no
transcendentals (GAP-0063 item 1); the bare-target route is a polynomial
kernel in the language, so bench.dart implements a range-reduced degree-6
expNeg and kernel.c/kernel_trapck.c run the IDENTICAL approximation statement
for statement. An @extern libm expf would be a different algorithm with
different rounding on almost every input and the bit-exact checksum would
refuse the pair. Accuracy is N0's NumPy-oracle business; this harness's
business is that both sides compute the same thing.

THE C BASELINES COMPILE UNDER #pragma STDC FP_CONTRACT OFF. dcc emits every
float multiply-add unfused (fmul+fadd, two roundings); clang's default fuses
to fmadd (one rounding), and the sides then differ by ulps the checksum
refuses -- observed on this benchmark's first run. CONSEQUENCE: this C
baseline foregoes real fmadd, so attention-f32 UNDER-prices DCDart's missing
FP contraction; matmul-f32, exact by construction, keeps an idiomatically
contracted C baseline and includes that cost. Read the pair together.

WHAT THE RATIO PRICES. No ARC in the hot path (five buffers, allocated once
per process call): float codegen + trapping integer VALUE arithmetic.
HISTORY: first measurement 3.679x, blamed on GAP-0034's blanket-volatile
Pointer<T>. ADR-0069 removed the volatile; the ratio did not move (3.631x).
The real cost was the old addressing idiom -- per-element trapping u64
address arithmetic + inttoptr, GAP-0070 -- fixed by ADR-0070's elementAt
(getelementptr addressing). Now: 1.056x +-0.3% vs plain C, 0.999x vs
trap-matched C. Softer than matmul-f32's historical gap throughout because
softmax's serial exp/divide is a bigger fraction of the kernel. The
migration changed no FP operation and no order; the bit-exact checksum
against the unchanged C baseline is the proof.

TRAPPING CAVEAT (neon/ROADMAP.md N2, published with every number from this
pair): FP does NOT trap; only integer index/LCG/checksum arithmetic differs
in kernel_trapck.c, so Ctrap/C lands well under integer-heavy benchmarks'
25-50%. Workload property, not evidence trapping is cheap.

CHECKSUM folds the output's raw f32 bit patterns (u32 view of the buffer)
modularly into u64 -- bit-exact equality required, tolerance refused.

NO bench_aot.dart, deliberately: stock Dart has no f32 type -- an AOT port
would compute in f64 (checksum mismatch, column refused) or benchmark a
Float32List round-trip emulation instead of the language. A stated absence
beats a misleading column."
