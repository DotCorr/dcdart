# core/ — the project

Everything buildable lives here — compiler pipeline, runtime, examples, tests, and the full
design-decision record (`docs/`). See the repo root `README.md` for the project overview.

Layout follows the compiler pipeline's own stages (frontend → lowering → IR → backend):

| Path | Maps to spec §1 stage | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `frontend/` | DCDart CFE (fork of `pkg/front_end`) | vendored at `vendor/dart-sdk/`, pinned at the `3.12.2` tag, `pub get` resolves cleanly (docs/decisions/0005, 0007). **`vendor/` is `.gitignore`'d, so a fresh clone has no `frontend/` at all and NOTHING in `core/` resolves until you run `scripts/vendor-frontend.sh`** — that script reproduces the vendor from the ADR-0005 sparse clone, re-applies ADR-0007's workspace-detach pubspec edits (which cannot survive a re-clone, since they live only in the ignored tree), and proves the result with a real `pub get` across all six packages (GAP-0021). Not invoked directly — shells to `dart compile kernel` instead (ADR-0008); the vendored copy is ready for when a real fork is needed |
| `dcc-lower/` | Kernel IR → DC-IR | **implemented, working, fully verified** for M0/M1 (all clauses) and M2's sixteen ARC/elision/recursion/mutability/control-flow/port-io/bitwise/move-semantics/if-else-merge slices, ADR-0016 through ADR-0032 (real heap objects, alias retain, calls, heap-typed signatures, heap-typed fields, `@owned` parameters, destructor cascade, weak references, redundant-pair elision, verified recursion, scalar reassignment, real `while`-loop control flow, x86 port I/O, move semantics, if/else merge blocks, heap field stores) |
| `dc-ir/` | DC-IR: typed SSA, explicit retain/release | real pub package (`dc_ir`), plain hosted Dart per ADR-0006. Arithmetic, `Load`/`Store`/`IntToPtr`/`PtrOffset`, `ICmp`, `Branch`/`CondBranch`, `MakeStruct`/`ExtractField`, `Alloc`/`Retain`/`Release`, `Call` (now carrying `argOwnership`, ADR-0031), `MakeWeak`/`WeakLoad`/`DropWeak`, `PortOut`/`PortIn` (M2, ADR-0018/0022/0023/0029), and `IDiv`/`IRem` (ADR-0036 — the only new instructions the whole operator-completion effort needed; `IMul` and all ten `ICmpPredicate` values had existed since M0 with no source operator wired to them). Consumed for real by `dcc-lower` and `backend` — `while`-loop back edges (ADR-0028) needed no new instructions, just real use of the block-parameter merge points already there |
| `dc-elide/` | Elision passes (spec §3.2) | **`elideRedundantRetainReleasePairs` implemented and verified** for pass 3 (ADR-0025) and pass 4's call-consumed case (ADR-0031) — a separate small package (only depends on `dc_ir`) purely so its own test suite can use `package:test`, which `dcc_lower`'s vendored-`kernel` dependency can't reconcile. 6 unit tests (3 positive, 3 negative/safety, including the critical "used again after an owned call" case) plus real end-to-end firing verified via `dc-objdump --arc` |
| `backend/` | DC-IR → LLVM IR → object file | **implemented, working, fully verified** for M0/M1, plus M2's real ARC codegen (`Alloc`/`Retain`/`Release` against a real segregated size-class heap, ADR-0058 — which replaced ADR-0015's fixed 64-slot arena; see the note below the table, because that arena's limits were why every M3 benchmark was unwritable), real function-call codegen (`Call`, ADR-0018), a real destructor-dispatch call through the object header's `cls` field (ADR-0022), real weak-reference codegen with zombie-slot semantics (ADR-0023), correct `phi`-predecessor tracking across internally-split blocks (ADR-0028, a real latent bug fixed), and real x86 port-I/O codegen via fixed inline asm (ADR-0029, verified against a real disassembly) — compiled via `clang -c` |
| `dcc/` | the `dcc` CLI driver | **`--target` selects the machine/OS (ADR-0033): `host`, `macos-arm64`, `linux-x86_64`, `windows-x86_64` and four more, defaulting to the original `bare-x86_64` so nothing that predates the flag changes. `--emit-header` writes a C header for FFI (ADR-0034).** **`dcc build --mode bare` produces real object files** for all thirty-six example targets below, all passing their conformance harnesses. `--mode hosted` still throws (no backend target designed for it) |
| `dc-objdump/` | ARC instruction counter (`CLAUDE.md`'s testing rules) | **`dc-objdump --arc <source.dart>` implemented and verified** (ADR-0024) — counts `Alloc`/`Retain`/`Release`/`MakeWeak`/`WeakLoad`/`DropWeak` per function at the DC-IR level (the only place these are countable at all — they're inlined, not symbols, by the time `backend` is done). Every count cross-checked exactly against every M2 ADR's own hand-derived trace, zero mismatches. Now also what proves ADR-0025's elision pass actually fires |
| `runtime/dc-core-bare/` | `dc:core.bare` — zero-dependency freestanding subset | `prelude.dart`: `bare`, `u64` (`+`, `-`, `<`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`), `u32`/`u16`/`u8` (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`), `Pointer<T>`, `@packed`/`Struct`, `Result` (`.ok`/`.err`/`.propagate()`), `HeapObject`, `@owned`, `Weak<T>`, `Port` (`.outb`/`.inb`) — see ADR-0008, 0010, 0011, 0014, 0016–0023, 0029, 0030. **All four sized-int widths now carry the full operator set** — `+ - * ~/ %` (all trapping) and `< <= > >= == !=` (ADR-0035/0036), where before only u64 had `+ - <` and the narrower widths had no arithmetic or comparison at all |
| `runtime/dc-core/` | `dc:core` — hosted stdlib | empty |
> **Read every "unqualified PASS" below with its host in mind.** Until 2026-08-26 the M0/M1/M2
> harnesses could only run on Linux/x86-64 — they linked with `-nostdlib` plus a hand-written Linux
> `sys_exit` stub and hard-*failed* on any other host, so the "32 passed, 0 failed" that had been
> quoted for weeks was a Linux-container number, not the dev host's. On macOS the real figure was
> 18/35. That is now fixed (`tests/conformance/_lib/hosted-link.sh`, GAP-0048) and the suite is
> **40 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped on Darwin/arm64** (35 before ADR-0057 added the `closure`
> target and ADR-0054 added `generic-class`; 39 before ADR-0060 added `funcptr`), but two things
> follow that the rows below do not say:
>
> - Several rows say things like "under real Linux". Those runs were real; they were just not the
>   only host that matters, and are no longer the only host that runs.
> - On a non-Linux host the freestanding check and the behavioural check now cover **two different
>   codegen targets** of the same source (`bare-x86_64` verified, `--target host` executed). Still
>   open as GAP-0048.
>
> Run it yourself with `bash core/tests/run-conformance.sh`; the summary line names the host and the
> link mode so no future reader repeats the mistake.

> **The heap was replaced on 2026-08-26 (ADR-0058), and the reason matters more than the change.**
> Until then DCDart allocated from ADR-0015's fixed `[64 x [64 x i8]]` arena — labelled at the time
> as a first proof of ARC codegen rather than an allocator, and never revisited. It permitted **64
> live objects, 48 bytes of fields, and no allocation inside a loop body at all.** All three failed
> loudly, so no wrong answer was ever produced and nothing drew attention to the aggregate — which
> was that **none of M3's five benchmarks could be written**, including the tree/graph traversal that
> needs no `String`, no generics and no closures and had been reported as the one that was fine.
> GAP-0050.
>
> Two consequences for reading the rows below:
>
> - **Every target here that allocates was sized to fit under 64** — most visibly `m2-recursion` at
>   depths 0–60. Those tests are correct and were honestly written, but the suite's green state
>   carried no information about allocation at any realistic scale, and no test in it would have
>   failed if the allocator had been far worse than it looked.
> - **`dc_free_top` is gone.** Leak tests now assert `dc_heap_live == 0`, which measures the property
>   they always wanted — nothing live — at any scale and across every size class, rather than "all 64
>   slots are free."
>
> Limits now: **65,536 live objects and 1 MiB per object** hosted (2,048 and 64 KiB freestanding,
> where `.bss` is physical frames a kernel must find at boot rather than address space an OS backs
> lazily). Still no coalescing and no cross-class reuse — stated in ADR-0058 because it is the single
> most likely thing to make an M3 number look better than a real allocator would.

| `examples/m0-seam/` | M0 target (`add.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/m0/run.sh`: unqualified PASS** |

| `examples/m1-struct/` | M1 target (`header.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/m1-struct/run.sh`: unqualified PASS** — cross-checked byte-for-byte against an independent C reference struct |
| `examples/m1-result/` | M1 target (`result_demo.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/m1-result/run.sh`: unqualified PASS** — real struct-by-value `Result` return, both `.propagate()` paths |
| `examples/m2-heap/` | M2 target (`box.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/m2-heap/run.sh`: unqualified PASS** — 1000 real alloc/construct/read/release cycles under real Linux, heap returns to baseline every time |
| `examples/m2-alias/` | M2 target (`alias.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/m2-alias/run.sh`: unqualified PASS** — 2000 real alias/read/release cycles (straight-line + branched), leak-free, proves Retain-on-alias (ADR-0017) |
| `examples/m2-call/` | M2 target (`calls.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/m2-call/run.sh`: unqualified PASS** — direct calls plus a call composed with `.propagate()`, proves `Call` (ADR-0018) |
| `examples/m2-heap-param/` | M2 target (`heap_param.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/m2-heap-param/run.sh`: unqualified PASS** — 1000 leak-free borrowed-parameter cycles + 60 bounded return-ownership-transfer calls, proves ADR-0019 |
| `examples/m2-heap-field/` | M2 target (`heap_field.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/m2-heap-field/run.sh`: unqualified PASS** — 1000 real nested-construct/read/destructor-cascade cycles, genuinely leak-free and UNBOUNDED (proves ADR-0020 + ADR-0022 together; originally a bounded, deliberate-leak test until the destructor cascade landed) |
| `examples/m2-owned/` | M2 target (`owned.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/m2-owned/run.sh`: unqualified PASS** — 1000 real construct/transfer/consume cycles, genuinely leak-free and UNBOUNDED, proves `@owned` (ADR-0021) |
| `examples/m2-weak/` | M2 target (`weak.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/m2-weak/run.sh`: unqualified PASS** — 1000 real weak-reference cycles (dangling + alive paths), exact zombie-slot arena counts, genuinely leak-free and UNBOUNDED, proves `Weak<T>` (ADR-0023) |
| `examples/m2-recursion/` | M2 target (`recursion.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/m2-recursion/run.sh`: unqualified PASS** — self-recursive calls, depths 0-60, a heap object per stack frame, all correct and leak-free, proves recursion (ADR-0026, closing ADR-0018's own "untested" flag) and the new `u64 operator -` |
| `examples/m2-mutable/` | M2 target (`mutable.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/m2-mutable/run.sh`: unqualified PASS** — 400 scalar reassignment checks (straight-line + branch-scoped), proves `VariableSet` lowering (ADR-0027) and the `_values` branch-scoping fix it required |
| `examples/m2-loop/` | M2 target (`loop.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/m2-loop/run.sh`: unqualified PASS** — real `while`-loop control flow: loop-carried scalar variables (`sumTo`, 50 checks) and a nested early-return inside a loop body (`firstAtLeast`, 19×15 checks), proves `_lowerWhile` (ADR-0028) and the backend `phi`-predecessor-label fix it required |
| `examples/m2-port/` | M2 target (`port_io.dart`) | **`tests/conformance/m2-port/run.sh`: unqualified PASS** — a real 16550 UART init sequence, verified STRUCTURALLY (disassembly shows exactly 7 `outb` + 1 `inb`, correct opcodes) since `outb`/`inb` are privileged instructions that can't run in a normal Linux process; proves `Port.outb`/`Port.inb` (ADR-0029) — the first DCDart feature built for a downstream project (`oscortex_core`) |
| `examples/m3-generic-class/` | M3 prerequisite (`generic_class.dart`, `recursive_reject.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/generic-class/run.sh`: PASS, natively on macOS/arm64** — monomorphized generic CLASSES (ADR-0054, closing GAP-0040), extending ADR-0052's generic functions. Four independent assertion families, because none catches the others' failures: the freestanding check; the SYMBOL TABLE (`Box$u64_unwrap`/`Box$u32_unwrap`/`Box$Node_unwrap`/`Box$Node_dtor` present, and `Box_unwrap`/`Box_dtor`/**`Box$u64_dtor`**/**`Box$u32_dtor`** absent — a destructor on a value-typed instantiation would release a `u64` as if it were a pointer, which no leak test can see); exact ARC counts via `dc-objdump --arc`, the first harness in the suite to assert them; and behaviour + leak over 1200 iterations across three instantiations. `Box<u64>` and `Box<Node>` are the pair that carries the argument — identical payload size, opposite ARC obligations. Plus a permanent NEGATIVE fixture, `recursive_reject.dart`, run under a timeout: recursion through a type parameter must be refused by name, and a hang is its own failure |
| `examples/m2-str/` | M2 target (`str.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/str/run.sh`: PASS** — string slices (ADR-0053). Asserts the spec §7 divergence directly: `"héllo".length` is **6 bytes, not 5 code units**, checked at runtime *and* on the emitted IR. Walks a literal's bytes through `.address` to prove the pointer reaches real `.rodata` rather than a plausible number, and asserts exactly five globals for five distinct literals so interning is proven to key on exact bytes |
| `examples/m2-closure/` | M2 target (`closure.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/closure/run.sh`: PASS** — NON-CAPTURING closures (ADR-0057). Read the scope, not the word: a local function that captures nothing hoists to an enclosing-qualified static symbol (`twiceSum$dbl`) and is called directly; a capturing closure is a compile ERROR pointing at escalation 0008 §2 (a function used as a VALUE no longer is — that is ADR-0060 and `examples/m3-funcptr/`). Asserts the hoist on the SYMBOL TABLE (an implementation that inlined every local function would compute identical answers), and carries the elision baseline escalation 0008 §3 predicts will be lost: `viaTopLevel` and `viaClosure` are the same program written two ways and `dc-objdump --arc` reports byte-identical counts with the `@owned` retain/release pair genuinely elided in both |
| `examples/m3-funcptr/` | M3 prerequisite (`funcptr.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/funcptr/run.sh`: PASS** — function pointers and indirect calls (**ADR-0060**, closing GAP-0052). A function can be torn off, passed to a higher-order function, returned from one, and called through the value; a DCDart higher-order function is also called **from C with a C function pointer**. Four assertion families, and the third is the unit's whole point: the freestanding check; an **indirect branch read out of the disassembly** of `dispatch` (a pointer chosen at run time and returned across a function boundary, so no optimizer can devirtualize it — an implementation that constant-folded every pointer would compute identical answers and prove nothing); the ARC counts; 2000 leak-free heap cycles. **`viaTopLevel`, `viaClosure`, `viaFuncPtr` and `viaTopFuncPtr` are the same program written four ways and all four emit `alloc=1 retain=0 release=0`** — an indirect call is NOT an elision barrier, contradicting escalation 0008 §3's prediction, because ownership rides in the `DCFuncPtr` type. `borrowViaFuncPtr` is asserted at `retain=1 release=2` in the same harness, so the good number cannot come from a blanket elision |
| `examples/m2-bitwise/` | M2 target (`bitwise.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/m2-bitwise/run.sh`: unqualified PASS** — real execution (unlike `m2-port`, these are unprivileged instructions): `&`/`|`/`^` exhaustive over a value range at `u64`, `<<`/`>>` over a range, `&` at `u32`/`u16`/`u8` too, proves ADR-0030 |
| `examples/demo-collatz/` | a real, hand-written program (not a single-ADR conformance target) | **not a `tests/conformance/` harness — a demo, kept in-repo.** A Collatz step-counter using a heap-object accumulator + `while` loop + arithmetic + bitwise ops together; links as an ORDINARY hosted C program (real `printf`, no `-nostdlib`). `collatzSteps(27) = 111`, the well-known correct value, checked independently, not just "it ran." Its second printed figure, `sum of collatzSteps(1..1000) = 59542`, is also independently checked now — it previously printed `59431` because `sumCollatzSteps`'s `while (i < upTo)` summed `1..upTo-1` while `main.c` labelled the result `1..upTo`, contradicting the function's own doc comment. An off-by-one in the demo, not in the compiler; fixed by spelling the inclusive bound `i < upTo + 1` (DCDart has no `<=` yet) Found two real gaps immediately (proves ADR-0032): `if`/`else` where both branches fall through wasn't supported (only guard-clause style was), and heap-object fields could be read but never written to |
| `examples/demo-account/` | a second real, hand-written program, deliberately exercising a DIFFERENT feature combination than `demo-collatz` | **not a `tests/conformance/` harness — a demo, kept in-repo.** A tiny bank-account simulator: `Result<T,E>`/`.propagate()` composed with a real heap object's field, read AND written (`acct.balance`, proving ADR-0032's store direction for real, not just Collatz's own accumulator field), plus a `while`-loop condition that itself reads a heap field directly. `openAndWithdrawTwice(100, 30) = Ok(40)`, `openAndWithdrawTwice(50, 30) = Err(1)` (second withdrawal correctly never attempted once the first fails — `.propagate()` short-circuiting for real), `drainAccount(100, 30) = 3` and `drainAccount(1000, 7) = 142` withdrawals, all independently hand-checked. Found zero new language gaps this time — a good sign that ADR-0032 actually closed the composition space it targeted |
| `examples/m2-arith/` | M2 target (`arith.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/m2-arith/run.sh`: PASS** — `*` at all four widths, `~/` and `%`, composed into real algorithms (gcd, digit-sum, modular power). Also asserts the TRAPS for real: `~/` by zero, `%` by zero and an overflowing `*` each kill the process with SIGTRAP, checked as "died by signal" rather than a hard-coded exit code (ADR-0035/0036) |
| `examples/m2-compare/` | M2 target (`compare.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/m2-compare/run.sh`: PASS** — `<`/`<=`/`>`/`>=` and `==`/`!=` at all four widths, ~330 checks concentrated on boundaries (equal operands, off-by-one either side, 0, each type's maximum). Proves the UNSIGNED predicates are selected: `ltU64(0, 18446744073709551615) == 1` is the case a signed predicate gets backwards (ADR-0035) |
| `examples/native-host/` | the cross-platform target (`native.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/native-host/run.sh`: PASS, natively on macOS/arm64** — builds with `--target host`, stays freestanding-clean, then links with PLAIN `clang` against real libc (no `-nostdlib`, no `-static`, no hand-written `_start.S`) and runs. **This harness deliberately has no Linux/x86-64 host gate**, unlike the sixteen that came before it; removing that gate is precisely what it exists to prove (ADR-0033) |
| `examples/ffi-header/` | the FFI target (`ffi.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/ffi-header/run.sh`: PASS, natively on macOS/arm64** — `--emit-header` writes a header from DC-IR; `main.c` includes it and declares **zero** `extern` prototypes of its own (compiled `-Werror`), so a wrong generated type is a build failure rather than silent ABI corruption. Covers u8/u16/u32/u64 prototypes, mixed-width params, a by-value `Result` struct, and the `(void)` zero-arg form (ADR-0034) |
| `examples/ffi-extern/` | the INBOUND FFI target (`extern_calls.dart` + `c_side.c`, `libc_calls.dart`, two `main.c`s) | **`tests/conformance/ffi-extern/run.sh`: PASS, natively on macOS/arm64** — DCDart calling C-ABI symbols it does not define (spec §9's other half, ADR-0038). Six steps: real undefined symbols + a generated `.externs` manifest; `verify-freestanding.sh` passing on the declared set; **the same object FAILING that check with its manifest removed** (an undeclared undefined symbol is still fatal — CLAUDE.md rule 1 is narrowed, not waived); a real freestanding four-object ELF link with zero undefined symbols left; a real native three-object link and run; and real **libc** calls (`ffs`/`toupper`/`putchar`) with the bytes `putchar` wrote checked on stdout. The rule-1 narrowing this required was escalated first and **ratified by the project owner** (`docs/escalations/0003-extern-c-calls-vs-freestanding.md`, option 2, 2026-08-20): rule 1 is now "zero undefined symbols *except ones the source explicitly declared*, checked mechanically" |
| `examples/demo-stats/` | a third real, hand-written program | **not a `tests/conformance/` harness — a demo.** C `malloc`s a `u32` array and owns it; DCDart walks it by raw pointer arithmetic (`Pointer<u32>.fromAddress(base + i * u64(4))`), computing sum, integer mean, max and a threshold count. Impossible before ADR-0035/0036/0037 — indexing needs `*`, the mean needs `~/`, and accumulating u32 into u64 needs `.toU64()`. Found two real gaps, in the same way `demo-collatz` did: there was **no way to widen an integer at all** (the representation field is library-private), and a named `const int` was rejected where a bare literal worked |
| `examples/m2-rodata/` | M2 target for static read-only data (`rodata.dart`, `main.c`) | **`tests/conformance/rodata/run.sh`: PASS, natively on macOS/arm64** — `@rodata final List<uN> t = const [...]` emits a bare `[N x iW]` into `.rodata`: no length word, no class pointer, width from the DECLARED type (the constant erases it), explicit `align`. The harness asserts emitted symbol SIZES on the freestanding object rather than documenting them, because a consumer reads these through a raw `Pointer<T>` where a header would silently shift every index. Also asserts distinct declarations land at distinct addresses, that no mergeable section is emitted, and that a `List<Ref>` produces real linker relocations (ADR-0040) |
| `tests/conformance/spine-reserved/` | integrity of the spine check itself | **PASS** — proves a manifest can never honor `dc_alloc`/`dc_throw`/`dc_orc_*`/`Dart_*` (it could, before: a manifest listing them produced `FREESTANDING: pass`, contradicting both the script's own header and escalation 0003's ratified wording), while ordinary declared externs are still honored and still reported. Uses hand-built C objects, because DCDart cannot emit a call to `dc_alloc` at all — this tests the CHECKER, not the compiler (GAP-0029) |
| `tests/conformance/no-red-zone/` | a property check, not a behaviour check | **PASS** — disassembles every example built for `bare-x86_64` and fails on any access below `%rsp`, plus asserts freestanding emission carries `noredzone` and hosted emission does not (ADR-0039). Shaped differently from every other harness on purpose: the defect it guards is **invisible to behavioural testing**, because the suite links `@bare` objects into ordinary hosted processes where the red zone is legitimate (GAP-0027) |
| `tests/conformance/`, `tests/leak/` | per `SKILL.md` §4 | **all thirty-six `run.sh` harnesses report an unqualified PASS on Darwin/arm64** (`36 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped`). The twenty-one that existed at the time were additionally verified under WSL2/Ubuntu and in a `linux/amd64` container from a macOS host; the fifteen added since have not been run on Linux, which is GAP-0048's still-open half, not a claim being made here. Three of the twenty-one (`native-host`, `ffi-header`, `ffi-extern`) carry NO Linux/x86-64 host gate by design and pass natively on macOS/arm64 too — that gate's removal is the feature they test (real freestanding link + real run on the actual `x86_64-unknown-none-elf` target, except `m2-port` which verifies structurally — see above). `tests/leak/` empty — the `m2-*` harnesses are the de facto leak tests; a dedicated `dc-test --leakcheck` harness is future work |
| `scripts/vendor-frontend.sh` | restores the `.gitignore`'d vendored frontend (GAP-0021) | **implemented and verified from a genuinely empty `core/frontend/`** on a clean macOS/arm64 machine — idempotent, `--force` re-clones, hard-fails if the checkout isn't ADR-0007's pinned commit |
| `scripts/verify-freestanding.sh` | the spine check (`CLAUDE.md` rule 1) | **`FREESTANDING: pass`** against real `dcc` output, all twenty-one targets, confirmed on Windows, Linux and macOS — and across **all eight `--target` values**, i.e. ELF, Mach-O and COFF on both x86-64 and aarch64, every one zero-undefined-symbol clean |
| `tools/bare-symbol-allowlist.txt` | consumed by the check above | still empty/draft — none of the twenty-one targets needed anything allowlisted. ADR-0038 deliberately did NOT add to it: a declared `@extern` symbol is recorded in a per-object `<obj>.o.externs` manifest instead, so the global allowlist stays E4's and stays empty |

## Current milestone: M1 done, M2's naive ARC insertion done, M2 overall in progress

**M1 — done.** All three exit-criterion clauses satisfied and verified end to end (real `dcc build` →
real freestanding link → real run, under WSL2/Ubuntu on the actual target):

1. ✅ **`Pointer<u32>` MMIO read/write** — `examples/m1-pointer/`, ADR-0010.
2. ✅ **`@packed` struct matching a known C layout byte-for-byte** — `examples/m1-struct/`, ADR-0011.
   Needed **zero changes to `core/backend`**.
3. ✅ **`Result<u64, Err>` via `?` propagation** — `examples/m1-result/`, ADR-0013/0014. `?` isn't
   valid Dart syntax (`escalations/0001`), approximated as `.propagate()`. A genuine struct-return ABI
   question came up mid-verification and was resolved by testing under the real target, not guessing
   — `docs/known-gaps.md` GAP-0007, worth reading as a case study in not fixing what isn't broken.

M0 is done the same way: real freestanding object, real overflow-trapping arithmetic (ADR-0009),
linked and run for real.

**M2's naive ARC insertion, destructor dispatch, AND weak references — DONE.** `ROADMAP.md`'s M2 exit
criterion is "allocation-heavy programs run leak-free... `weak` references nil out correctly...
elision firing" — the FULL criterion needs later work too (see below), but every ownership-transfer,
object-death, AND weak-reference shape `DCDART_SPEC.md` §3.1/§3.2/§3.3-layer-1 describes now has real,
verified codegen, across fifteen ADRs:

1. **(ADR-0015/0016)** The core mechanism: `Alloc`/`Retain`/`Release` codegen against a fixed internal
   arena (explicitly NOT the real `Allocator` — spec §12's open decision 2, `escalations/0002`), real
   heap object construction and field access from source (`class Box extends HeapObject`), naive
   release-on-scope-exit. `examples/m2-heap/box.dart`: 1000 real cycles, leak-free.
2. **(ADR-0017)** Local-to-local aliasing (`final b2 = b;`) — tracking heap locals by
   `VariableDeclaration` identity, not `DCValue` identity (two locals can share one DCValue with no
   copy instruction to tell them apart). `examples/m2-alias/alias.dart`: 2000 real cycles, leak-free.
3. **(ADR-0018)** Real function-to-function calls — a new `Call` DC-IR instruction, discovered as a
   totally missing gap (GAP-0018) while scoping this work: there was no way to call one `@bare`
   function from another at all before this. `examples/m2-call/calls.dart`: direct calls plus a call
   composed with `.propagate()`.
4. **(ADR-0019)** Heap-typed function parameters (borrowed by default, spec §3.2 item 2) and return
   types. `examples/m2-heap-param/heap_param.dart`: 1000 leak-free borrowed-parameter cycles + a
   *bounded* return-transfer test (bounded because nothing could release a returned reference yet).
5. **(ADR-0020)** A `HeapObject` field referencing another `HeapObject`.
6. **(ADR-0021)** `@owned` parameters — spec §3.2 item 2's other half ("Only `@owned` params
   transfer"), found already specified in the spec rather than needing a fresh design decision.
   `examples/m2-owned/owned.dart`: **1000 real cycles, genuinely leak-free and UNBOUNDED** — the first
   M2 heap-signature target that didn't have to stop short of the arena's capacity.
7. **(ADR-0022)** A destructor cascade — `Alloc` writes a destructor function's address into the
   object header's `cls` field (spec §3.1) at construction; `Release`'s codegen (needing NO shape
   change at all — exactly as its own original doc comment anticipated) calls through it when non-null,
   before freeing the slot. `examples/m2-heap-field/heap_field.dart` — ADR-0020's own target — was
   rewritten in place from asserting a deliberate, bounded, predicted leak to asserting **1000 real
   cycles, genuinely leak-free and UNBOUNDED**, once the destructor that fixes exactly that leak
   existed. **This is a direct destructor call, not a real `ClassInfo` vtable** — there's no dynamic
   dispatch anywhere in DCDart yet (spec §4.3, M5+), so every heap object's concrete class is always
   statically known at its `Alloc` site; a real multi-slot vtable is correctly deferred, not built
   prematurely — see the ADR's "Rejected alternative."
8. **(ADR-0023)** `weak` references (spec §3.3 layer 1) — a new `DCWeakPointer` type,
   `MakeWeak`/`WeakLoad`/`DropWeak` DC-IR instructions, and "zombie slot" semantics: a dying object
   with an outstanding weak reference is left `strong == 0` but NOT yet freed, until its last weak
   reference also drops. `examples/m2-weak/weak.dart`: **1000 real cycles, genuinely leak-free and
   UNBOUNDED**, both the "target already died" path (nils out correctly) and the "target still alive"
   path (retains and returns the live reference), with exact zombie-slot arena counts matching the
   predicted values at every intermediate step — and it passed on the FIRST real build, every
   intermediate prediction in the design holding up empirically without a single fix needed.
9. **(ADR-0025)** The first real elision pass — spec §3.2 pass 3, redundant-pair removal
   (`retain(x); ...; release(x)` with no release of `x` in between → delete both). Discovered, while
   scoping "what's left," a real correction: `ROADMAP.md`'s own M2 exit text names "`dc-objdump --arc`
   shows elision firing" as M2 scope, not M3's (M3 is specifically the LATER ≤10%-overhead
   *measurement*) — earlier framing in this project's own docs had this wrong. `dc-objdump --arc`
   (ADR-0024) now shows it firing concretely: `examples/m2-alias/alias.dart`'s
   `makeAliasAndReadValue` goes from `retain=1 release=2` to `retain=0 release=1`, verified before and
   after, with `examples/m2-owned/owned.dart` and `examples/m2-weak/weak.dart` provably UNCHANGED
   (two dedicated negative tests prove the pass correctly refuses to cancel a pair spanning a `Call` or
   a weak op, where doing so would be unsafe). Lives in a new small package, `core/dc-elide/`, purely
   so its own test suite can depend on `package:test` — `dcc_lower`'s vendored-`kernel` path dependency
   makes that impossible in `dcc_lower`'s own pubspec.

10. **(ADR-0027)** Scalar (non-heap) local variable reassignment — `VariableSet` lowering for
    same-width `u8`/`u32`/`u64` locals, one prerequisite of two for a real loop construct (the other,
    loop control flow, remains unimplemented). Found and fixed a real SSA-dominance bug along the way:
    `_values` (the variable-binding table) lacked the same per-branch snapshot/restore `_heapLocals`/
    `_weakLocals` already had, so a reassignment inside an `if`-branch leaked into a sibling branch or
    the fallthrough continuation. `examples/m2-mutable/mutable.dart`: 400 checks (straight-line +
    branch-scoped), all correct after the fix.
11. **(ADR-0028)** Real `while`-loop control flow — the second, remaining prerequisite for a general
    loop. Needed zero new DC-IR instructions: a loop header is just an ordinary block-parameter merge
    point, which `core/backend`'s phi-emission logic already handled generically for ANY predecessor,
    not just `if`/`else`. `_lowerWhile` threads loop-carried scalar locals through the header, composes
    for free with nested `if` (including its guard-clause early-`return` pattern). Found and fixed a
    real BACKEND bug along the way, latent since M0: `phi`-predecessor labels were computed from a DC-IR
    block's nominal label, not the real final LLVM label after internal sub-block splitting (arithmetic
    overflow trapping, `Alloc`'s OOM check, `Release`'s destructor path, `WeakLoad`'s dead/alive split
    all split one DC-IR block into several real LLVM blocks) — invisible until a loop's back edge became
    the first non-empty-args branch to follow a block containing arithmetic. Fixed via a two-pass
    emission restructure in `llvm_emit.dart`. `examples/m2-loop/loop.dart`: loop-carried-variable
    threading (`sumTo`, 50 checks) plus a nested early-return inside a loop body (`firstAtLeast`,
    19×15 checks), all correct. Heap/weak locals inside a loop body remain explicitly unsupported (no
    ARC-across-back-edge policy designed yet).

12. **(ADR-0029)** x86 port I/O (`Port.outb`/`Port.inb`) — the first DCDart feature built for a
    downstream project, `oscortex_core` (a from-scratch OS being developed alongside DCDart, its own
    separate repo/project). A narrow `PortOut`/`PortIn` DC-IR instruction pair with a FIXED LLVM
    inline-asm shape, deliberately not general `asm`/`@naked`/extern-FFI (spec §6/§9, GAP-0019, correctly
    deferred). Also generalized sized-int literal construction from u64-only to u8/u16/u32/u64
    uniformly, and added the project's first void-returning-call-as-statement support
    (`Port.outb(...)`, since `_lowerExpression` can't return a value for a void call).
    `examples/m2-port/port_io.dart`: a real 16550 UART init sequence, verified structurally (disassembly
    confirms exactly 7 `outb` + 1 `inb`, correct opcodes) since these are privileged, ring-0-only
    instructions that can't run as a normal Linux process — the LLVM inline-asm syntax itself was
    test-compiled and disassembled standalone before being wired into the backend, not assumed correct.

13. **(ADR-0030)** Bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`) — the second DCDart feature built for
    `oscortex_core` (its interrupts milestone needs IDT/PIC/UART register-flag manipulation). New
    `IAnd`/`IOr`/`IXor`/`IShl`/`IShr` DC-IR instructions (no `Overflow` field — bitwise ops don't trap);
    `IShr`'s logical-vs-arithmetic choice reads the operand's own signedness at the backend rather than
    needing a second instruction. Added to all four sized-int widths (`u8`/`u16`/`u32`/`u64`) at once,
    unlike earlier operators added one at a time — the real motivating uses span multiple widths in the
    same milestone. `dcc-lower` recognition generalized to one block (parsing `target.name.text` via
    `indexOf('|')`, not `String.split('|')` — the OR operator's own name is literally `|`, which split
    would mis-parse) instead of twenty near-identical ones. `examples/m2-bitwise/bitwise.dart`: real
    execution (not just structural — these are unprivileged instructions), `&`/`|`/`^` exhaustive over a
    range at `u64`, `<<`/`>>` over a range, `&` at `u32`/`u16`/`u8`, all correct.

14. **(ADR-0031)** Move semantics (spec §3.2 pass 4) — resolved for the call-consumed,
    single-owned-argument case, scoped from a real example rather than speculatively.
    `Call` gained `argOwnership: List<bool>`; `dc-elide` now lets a pending retain survive a `Call`
    when it matches an owned-consumed argument, but under a STRICTLY STRONGER invalidation rule than an
    ordinary pending retain (any later reference at all invalidates it, not just an opaque op) — the
    ADR's own "critical correctness subtlety" explains why the weaker ordinary-pair rule isn't safe
    here (cancelling this pair hands the object's LAST reference directly to the callee, unlike an
    ordinary pair kept alive by some other reference regardless). `m2-owned/owned.dart`'s
    `makeAndDropViaCall` goes from `retain=1 release=1` to `retain=0 release=0`, verified via
    `dc-objdump --arc` on the real compiled source — exactly the number `known-gaps.md`'s own entry had
    already named as the target. A dedicated negative test proves a "used again after the owned call"
    shape is correctly left alone — the single most important safety check for this feature. General
    move-semantics cases (struct fields, plain last-read moves, loop back-edges) remain unimplemented,
    scoped for later.

15. **(ADR-0032)** if/else merge blocks, and heap object field stores — found by writing
    `examples/demo-collatz/`, the project's first real, hand-written program rather than a single-ADR
    conformance target. `_lowerIf` only ever supported branches that terminate (`return`); a plain
    conditional reassignment (`if (cond) { x = 1; } else { x = 2; }`, arguably the single most common
    shape in imperative code) threw immediately. Now supported via a real DC-IR merge block — the exact
    same block-parameter mechanism `_lowerWhile`'s own header already uses — reusing (not
    reimplementing) the same variable-scan helper both now share. Separately, `_lowerHeapFieldLoad`
    existed since ADR-0016/0020 but its Store-direction counterpart never did; added
    `_lowerHeapFieldStore` (scalar fields only — heap/weak-typed field stores raise the same
    undecided ownership question as scalar-vs-heap local reassignment, GAP-0020). The demo now produces
    the mathematically correct answer (`collatzSteps(27) = 111`, the well-known reference value),
    independently checkable — real proof, not just "it compiled."

**Native code generation for every platform C targets, and a real C FFI surface (ADR-0033 through
ADR-0037).** Four things landed together, and the first is much larger than it looks:

16. **(ADR-0033)** DCDart compiles to **native macOS, Windows and Linux objects**, on x86-64 and
    aarch64. What was actually blocking this was a single hardcoded line in `dcc/lib/pipeline.dart`
    (`const targetTriple = 'x86_64-unknown-none-elf'`), not anything in the backend: `emitModule` and
    `compileToObject` both already took a triple, the emitted IR has no `datalayout`, no `dso_local`
    and no custom calling convention (`m0-target.md` §1 decided that deliberately), and the trap
    machinery uses portable LLVM intrinsics. Proof: passing an arm64 Apple triple to the UNMODIFIED
    backend produced a Mach-O object that linked into an ordinary macOS binary and ran correctly on
    the first attempt — **17 of the 18 example targets, including the entire ARC suite (heap objects,
    weak references, the destructor cascade, `@owned` transfer), ran natively on arm64 with zero
    codegen changes.** The 18th, `m2-port`, correctly failed: `outb`/`inb` are x86-only, and now say
    so in one sentence instead of failing deep inside `clang`. The deeper fix was conceptual —
    `--mode` (which language subset) and `--target` (which machine) had been conflated, and they are
    orthogonal: a `@bare` object is a plain C-ABI object, which is why `demo-collatz` had been linking
    into an ordinary hosted C program since ADR-0032. All eight targets cross-compile from one macOS
    machine and all eight are zero-undefined-symbol clean.
17. **(ADR-0034)** `dcc --emit-header` generates the C declarations from the same DC-IR the object
    comes from, so a caller cannot hand-write a prototype that silently disagrees with the real ABI.
    Verified with a C program that includes only the generated header and calls a DCDart function
    returning `Result<u64,u64>` **by value**. `DCBool` is deliberately REFUSED rather than mapped —
    it is LLVM `i1`, C's `_Bool` is a byte, and spelling it `bool` would produce a header that
    compiles, links and is silently wrong.
18. **(ADR-0035)** The integer operator set, completed at all four widths: `*`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`,
    `==`, `!=`, plus `+`/`-` on the three narrower widths that never had them. Almost none of this
    needed new codegen — `IMul` and all ten `ICmpPredicate` values had existed since M0 with no
    operator wired to them. `==`/`!=` are the exception and could NOT use the same mechanism: **Dart
    refuses to let an extension type declare `operator ==`**, so they lower from a structurally
    different Kernel node (`EqualsCall`, and `Not(EqualsCall)` for `!=`). The three dedicated
    `u64|+`/`u64|<`/`u64|-` blocks were deleted in favour of the general path rather than left
    alongside it.
19. **(ADR-0036)** `~/` and `%`, with an explicit zero-divisor trap. Division needed the only genuinely
    new instructions here (`IDiv`/`IRem`) because it fails differently from `+`/`-`/`*`: LLVM has no
    overflow intrinsic for it, and `udiv iN %a, 0` is immediate UB producing `poison`, not a fault
    that can be relied on. Spelled `~/` (Dart's integer division) rather than `/`, which in Dart
    returns a `double`. Signed division is REJECTED, not emitted, since it needs a second guard for
    `INT_MIN / -1` (GAP-0024).
20. **(ADR-0037)** Explicit width conversions (`.toU8()`…`.toU64()`) and named `const int`s — both
    found by writing `examples/demo-stats/`, not by planning. Before this there was **no way to widen
    an integer at all**: the representation field is library-private, so summing a `u32` array into a
    `u64` was inexpressible. Spec §4.1 had already decided the answer ("`u8 → u32` requires
    `.toU32()`"), making this unimplemented spec rather than a new decision.

Together these are what make the language usable for real programs: verified running natively —
Euclid's gcd, digit-sum, trial-division primality, factorial (`factorial(20)` correct at the u64
limit, `factorial(21)` trapping rather than wrapping), and an array walked by raw pointer arithmetic
over a buffer C owns.

Every slice was verified against the FULL conformance suite (all thirty-two targets) after landing, zero
regressions at any step — see `docs/known-gaps.md` GAP-0017/GAP-0003/GAP-0019/GAP-0020 for the itemized
history.

**What M2 still needs** (elision's remaining passes — escape analysis, borrow inference proper, move
semantics, uniqueness/reuse, spec §3.2 passes 1/2/4/5 — each a real, larger analysis, appropriately
sequenced after item 9's first pass proved the mechanism) is genuinely M2-scope work, not deferred; a
FULL M3 ≤10%-overhead pass needs all of it, but M2's own literal exit text is satisfied by "elision
firing," which item 9 already demonstrates. **Correctly scoped as LATER milestone work**, confirmed
directly against `ROADMAP.md`'s own M2 work-item list (which never mentions cycle collection at all):
cycle collection (spec §3.3 layers 2/3 — item 8's `weak` mechanism and item 7's destructor cascade are
its two prerequisites, both now real), `unowned` (spec §3.3's other layer-1 variant, trap-on-dead-
access instead of nil-on-dead-access), and a real `ClassInfo` vtable for genuine dynamic dispatch (M5+,
GAP-0003 retitled, not closed outright).

**What closed GAP-0005** (the Windows-can't-link-ELF blocker common to every target): WSL2 + Ubuntu,
`clang`/`llvm-nm` (apt), a matching Linux Dart SDK. Local tooling gap, not a DCDart limitation — `dcc`
itself ran fine on Windows all along.
