// core/dcc/lib/pipeline.dart

// The real compilation pipeline, per DCDART_SPEC.md §1 `[LOAD-BEARING]`:
//
//   .dart -> [dart compile kernel] -> Kernel IR (.dill) -> [dcc-lower] ->
//   DC-IR -> [backend] -> LLVM IR -> [clang -c] -> object file
//
// See core/docs/decisions/0008-m0-frontend-strategy.md for why the first
// arrow is "the installed SDK's `dart compile kernel`" rather than "the
// vendored pkg/front_end in-process" — that's a deliberate M0 scoping
// choice, not a shortcut nobody noticed.
//
// M0 scope only: recognizes exactly what core/dcc-lower/lib/lower.dart
// recognizes (one `@bare` top-level function, u64 params/return, `a + b`
// body) and nothing past it — see that file's header for the exact cut and
// core/docs/known-gaps.md for what's tracked as still open.
