// core/dcc/lib/cli_args.dart
//
// Hand-rolled argument parsing for the `dcc` CLI driver.
//
// No external packages -- not even package:args from pub.dev. dcc is
// bootstrap tooling that needs to run the moment a bare Dart SDK lands on
// PATH in this environment, without a `dart pub get` step (no vendored
// packages, possibly no network). See
// core/docs/decisions/0002-dcc-bootstrap-language.md.
//
// M0 scope only: one subcommand (`build`), three flags/positionals
// (`--mode`, input path, `-o`/`--output`). Extend as later milestones add
// subcommands -- do not pre-build flags nothing calls yet.

const String usage = '''
Usage: dcc build --mode <bare|hosted> [--target <target>] <input.dart> -o <output.o>

Commands:
  build     Compile a DCDart source file to a native object file.

Options for build:
  --mode <bare|hosted>     Compilation mode (DCDART_SPEC.md §2). Required.
  --target <target>        Machine/OS to emit for. Optional; defaults to
                           bare-x86_64. Use "host" for the current machine.
                           Orthogonal to --mode: a @bare object is a plain
                           C-ABI object and links into an ordinary native
                           program on any of these.
  --allow-fp               Permit FP/SIMD registers on a FREESTANDING target.
                           Off by default: LLVM vectorizes ordinary integer
                           loops into xorps/movaps, putting SSE into @bare
                           objects with no floating point in them, which
                           silently breaks a kernel that defers saving FPU
                           state. On x86-64 a float MEANS xmm, so pass this
                           when you want FP in @bare and accept that
                           obligation. Hosted targets are unaffected.
  --prelude <path>         Which file is the prelude. Defaults to the one
                           beside this dcc. `@bare` is recognised by comparing
                           library URIs as EXACT equality on a lexically
                           normalised path (symlinks resolved on neither
                           side), so a program importing the prelude by a
                           different spelling has no @bare functions as far as
                           dcc is concerned. Use this when your source lives
                           outside the DCDart repo.
  --heap-region-bytes <n>  Bytes per size-class heap region (ADR-0058).
                           Power of two, >= 4096. Total heap is 8x this.
                           Default: 2 MiB per class hosted (16 MiB total),
                           64 KiB per class freestanding (512 KiB total) --
                           freestanding .bss is physical frames a kernel must
                           find at boot, not address space an OS backs lazily.
  --emit-header <path>     Also write a C header declaring every exported
                           function, so C/Rust/Python can FFI into it.
  -o, --output <path>      Output object file path. Required.
  <input.dart>             Positional. Path to the DCDart source file.

  -h, --help               Show this message.

Exit codes:
  0   success
  64  usage error (bad or missing arguments)
  65  input file does not exist
  1   valid invocation, but compilation failed (frontend, dcc-lower, or
      backend error -- see stderr for which stage and why)
