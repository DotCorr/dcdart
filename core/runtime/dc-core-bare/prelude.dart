//
// M0/M1's minimal syntax surface (see core/docs/decisions/0008-m0-frontend-strategy.md,
// 0010-pointer-load-store.md). Lets real, UNMODIFIED, vendored pkg/front_end parse and
// type-check DCDart-shaped source (`@bare u64 add(u64 a, u64 b) => a + b;`,
// `Pointer<u32>.fromAddress(addr).value`) with zero source changes to front_end
// itself. This is NOT the real DCDart CFE fork DCDART_SPEC.md §1 ultimately wants
// (true builtin syntax needing no import, real @bare semantic enforcement) --
// see ADR-0008 for why this is the right first step and what it defers to a real
// front_end fork.
//
// core/dcc-lower reads this library's declarations back out of the Kernel IR it
// produces (verified empirically, not guessed -- see ADR-0008, ADR-0010): `@bare`
// becomes a `ConstantExpression` annotation wrapping an `InstanceConstant` of
// `_Bare`; `u64`/`u32` become real `ExtensionType` DartType nodes; `a + b` becomes
// a `StaticInvocation` of the extension type's synthesized `|+` member;
// `Pointer<T>.fromAddress(x)` becomes a `ConstructorInvocation`;
// `p.value`/`p.value = x` become `InstanceGet`/`InstanceSet`. dcc-lower matches
// every one of these by name AND by this library's URI, so an unrelated
// user-defined type/member elsewhere can never be misread as DCDart syntax.
//
// IMPORTANT: none of these Dart-level method/operator BODIES are ever executed.
// dcc-lower recognizes the *shape* of a call/access in Kernel IR (which class,
// which library, which member name) and substitutes its own DC-IR instructions
// -- it does not read or lower the body expressions below. They exist only so
// real front_end has something type-correct to check DCDart source against.
// `throw UnimplementedError(...)` bodies are deliberate for exactly this reason:
// a body that looks like it does real work would be misleading about what
// actually determines DCDart's semantics (dcc-lower's pattern matching, not this
// file's Dart code).

/// Marks a top-level function `@bare` (DCDART_SPEC.md §2). dcc-lower's ONLY use of
/// this annotation for M0 is "does this function exist for DC-IR purposes at all" --
/// none of @bare's real semantics (no allocator, no exceptions, no ORC) are enforced
/// here or by dcc-lower yet. Real enforcement needs an actual front_end fork (a
/// dedicated diagnostic pass rejecting `throw`/allocation/etc. inside @bare bodies),
/// which is M1+ work, not M0's.
