// Spec §3.2 pass 3: redundant-pair removal. "retain(x); ...; release(x)
// with no release of x in between -> delete both." The first elision
// pass this project implements (docs/decisions/0025-redundant-pair-
// removal.md) -- ROADMAP.md's M2 exit criterion literally names
// "dc-objdump --arc shows elision firing on the reference benchmark" as
// part of M2, not M3 (M3 is specifically the LATER ≤10%-overhead
// measurement gate) -- see docs/known-gaps.md GAP-0017 item 2's
// correction. `dc-objdump --arc` (ADR-0024) is what makes "firing"
// concretely checkable: the same source should show smaller retain/
// release counts after this pass runs than before.
//
// A SEPARATE package from dcc-lower (not lib/elide.dart there), purely
// for dependency hygiene: this file only needs `dc_ir` (zero transitive
// dependencies), which is what lets its own test suite depend on
// `package:test` at all -- `dcc_lower`'s pubspec also depends on the
// vendored `kernel` package (path dependency, pinning `_fe_analyzer_shared`
// to a local path version), which pub cannot reconcile with `package:test`'s
// own (hosted) `_fe_analyzer_shared` requirement in the SAME pubspec. Kept
// here, imported BY dcc-lower, rather than accepting no test coverage for
// something this safety-sensitive (CLAUDE.md: "Regressions in elision are
// invisible at runtime and catastrophic in aggregate").
//
// SAFETY, read before touching this file: every simplification below is
// deliberately conservative, chosen because it is PROVABLY safe at the
// DC-IR level, not because it is maximally aggressive. Getting this wrong
// means a double-free or a premature free that no conformance test's
// normal "does it crash" check would reliably catch (the arena is tiny --
// 64 slots -- so it tends to surface eventually, but "tends to" is not a
// proof).
//
// Scope, deliberately conservative:
//   1. Per-block matching first; then ADR-0066 rule F's cross-block
//      FRONTIER pass (`_elideCrossBlock`) extends it to a retain whose
//      matching release sits on every path out of its block -- refusing
//      on missing dominance, anything opaque in between, or (ADR-0068) a
//      retain or frontier release whose own block lies on a CFG cycle;
//      ARC-free interior loops BETWEEN the pair are walked through.
//      A retain neither pass can match is left alone.
//   2. A `Call` instruction invalidates every pending retain, EXCEPT (a)
//      one matching an argument the call fully consumes
//      (`Call.argOwnership`, docs/decisions/0031-move-semantics.md, spec
//      §3.2 pass 4 -- see that ADR for why this specific case is provably
//      safe; a pending retain that survives this way is tracked more
//      strictly than an ordinary one, below), and (b) ALL ordinary
//      pending retains when the callee is in the module's
//      REFCOUNT-TRANSPARENT set (ADR-0066 rule T,
//      `computeRefcountTransparentCallees`: proven, transitively, to
//      contain only per-vid-covered releases -- so it can never decrement
//      any object below its call-entry count). Every other call is as
//      opaque as ever: the callee could release a borrowed reference's
//      object, and m2-owned's makeAndDropViaCall is ADR-0025's own worked
//      example of exactly that ambiguity.
//   3. `MakeWeak`/`WeakLoad`/`DropWeak` ALSO invalidate every pending
//      retain, even though they operate on a DIFFERENT DCValue (a
//      DCWeakPointer, not the DCHeapPointer a pending retain tracks).
//      Why: a weak pointer's numeric address is identical to the strong
//      pointer it was made from (ADR-0023) -- this pass has no way to
//      prove, at the DC-IR level, that some OTHER value's WeakLoad isn't
//      quietly retaining the SAME object my pending retain is tracking
//      (WeakLoad's own codegen increments `strong` when the target is
//      alive). Treating these as opaque, exactly like Call, is the safe
//      choice.
//   4. A SURVIVING `Release` -- of ANY value, not just a matching one --
//      invalidates every pending retain (ADR-0063, closing GAP-0054).
//      A `Release` that this pass DELETES as half of a cancelled pair
//      does not, because it never executes. This is the rule that makes
//      pass 3 safe on its own terms rather than by accident; the long
//      note at the `Release` case below states the invariant and proves
//      it, and says what used to stand in for it.
//      ONE derived exception (escalation 0011 Option C, owner-decided
//      2026-08-27): a pending retain whose object is provably FRESH at
//      that point -- defined in this block by `Alloc` or by a direct
//      `Call` to a RETURNS-FRESH callee (`computeReturnsFreshCallees`),
//      and not referenced since except by Retain/Release of itself, a
//      null test, or loads/stores THROUGH it into its own payload -- is
//      spared: no other value, no heap location and no weak reference
//      can denote its object, so neither the surviving release's own
//      decrement nor any destructor cascade it starts can reach it. The
//      OPPOSITE direction is deliberately NOT taken: a surviving release
//      OF a fresh value still invalidates every other pending retain,
//      because releasing the sole reference to a fresh object fires its
//      destructor, and the cascade releases whatever pre-existing
//      objects its fields hold -- see `_FreshTracker` for both arguments
//      and the ADR for the negative test pinning the refusal.
//      ONE derived exception (escalation 0011 Option C, owner-decided
//      2026-08-27): a pending retain whose value is PROVABLY FRESH -- the
//      block-local result of an `Alloc`, or of a direct `Call` to a
//      callee in the module's RETURNS-FRESH set
//      (`computeReturnsFreshCallees`), that has not since been aliased or
//      escaped in any way -- is carried across a surviving release OF A
//      DIFFERENT value. Nothing anywhere (no SSA value, no heap field, no
//      weak) references a fresh object except its defining value, so
//      neither the released object nor any destructor cascade it triggers
//      can decrement the fresh object's count. The other direction is
//      NOT taken: a surviving release OF a fresh value still invalidates
//      every other pending retain, because zeroing the fresh object runs
//      its destructor, and the fresh object's fields may hold the very
//      object another pending retain protects (`wrap(x) => Cell(x)`).
//   5. Everything else (arithmetic, Load/Store/PtrOffset/IntToPtr,
//      ConstInt, Alloc and Retain on OTHER values, terminators) is
//      safe to skip over without invalidating an ORDINARY pending
//      retain: Alloc always allocates a fresh, previously-unused header
//      (can't alias a pending retain's object); PtrOffset/Load/Store
//      only ever touch a PAYLOAD offset (non-negative, ADR-0016), never
//      the header, which sits at a fixed NEGATIVE offset -- so no plain
//      memory op can corrupt a refcount. This does NOT extend to a
//      call-consumed candidate from rule 2 -- see its own note below for
//      why that one needs a strictly stronger rule.
//
//      NOTE what rules 2-4 have in common, because it is the whole
//      safety story: the ONLY three ways a refcount can go DOWN are an
//      executed `Release`, an opaque callee, and a weak op. Each is
//      handled by clearing. Nothing else in DC-IR can decrement a
//      refcount, so nothing else can end an object's life early.

///      never goes negative. A covered release only ever undoes an increment

/// THE SAFETY ARGUMENT (ADR-0066 rule F, superseding ADR-0025's single-exit

/// `Release v` instructions -- one release on every path leaving the retain
/// -- when all of the following hold, each refusing rather than

///
///   1. THE RETAIN'S BLOCK AND EVERY FRONTIER BLOCK EXECUTE AT MOST ONCE
///      PER CALL: none of them lies on a CFG cycle (is reachable from
///      itself). Without this a retain inside a loop pairs with one release
///      outside it -- N retains, one release -- and cancelling them would
///      under-release (and symmetrically for a release inside a loop).
///      Blocks BETWEEN the retain and the frontier MAY lie on cycles
///      (ADR-0068 extends ADR-0066 rule F here): an interior loop is safe
///      exactly because condition 2's walk scans every block it can visit,
///      so a loop body containing any `Release`, any opaque op, or a
///      `Retain v` fails the candidate anyway -- what executes N times is
///      then provably refcount-irrelevant to this pair. The live case is
///      NEON's `loaderNextBatch`: retain in the entry block, two ARC-free
///      copy loops, release in the single exit.
///   2. EVERY PATH from the retain reaches exactly one frontier member
///      before anything that could decrement a refcount. Established by a
///      forward walk from the instruction after the retain: the walk STOPS
///      a path at the first unclaimed `Release v` (that release joins the
///      frontier) and FAILS the whole candidate on any of -- a `Retain v`
///      (ambiguous pairing), anything opaque (`_isOpaqueForPendingRetain`:
///      a surviving `Release` of ANY other value per ADR-0063, a
///      non-transparent or owned-consuming `Call`, any `IndirectCall` or
///      weak op), or a `Return` reached with no release (a path that would
///      leak). Instructions already CLAIMED by a previously-accepted pair
///      are skipped: they are deleted, so they never execute (same
///      reasoning as the per-block pass's deleted-release rule).
///   3. A DOMINATES every frontier block. Every execution of a frontier
///      release was therefore preceded by this retain -- no path can lose a
///      release without also having lost the retain. (The retain's own
///      block executing implies the retain executed: blocks are
///      straight-line.)
///   4. NO FRONTIER MEMBER REACHES ANOTHER. If one frontier block could
///      flow into a second, a single execution would shed one retain and
///      TWO releases -- an over-release avoided by refusing outright. (In
///      the shapes this pass exists for, frontier blocks end in `Return`,
///      so the check is trivially met; it is still checked.)
///
/// With 1-4, each execution through the retain deletes exactly one retain
/// and exactly one release, and inside the deleted interval the transformed
/// program performs no decrement of anything -- so ADR-0063's gap invariant
/// (counts agree at boundaries, only rise inside, boundary >= 1) holds
/// verbatim, per path. Spelled out for the loop-tolerant form (ADR-0068):
/// the retain's block A is not on a cycle, so the retain executes at most
/// once per call; every frontier release's block likewise; condition 3 makes
/// every frontier execution follow the retain; condition 2's walk visited --
/// and fully scanned -- every block any interval execution can touch,
/// interior loop bodies included, so however many times such a body runs
/// inside the interval it decrements nothing. A path that enters an interior
/// loop and never leaves performs no decrement either and never reaches a
/// Return, so no balance is ever observed on it. Dominance is computed by
/// the standard iterative fixpoint, valid on cyclic CFGs; the DAG shortcut
/// the ADR-0066 form used is gone along with its whole-function back-edge
/// refusal.
///
/// Compared to the ADR-0025 version this replaces: multiple `Return` blocks
/// are handled (the frontier), opacity is checked over exactly the blocks
/// REACHABLE from the retain rather than an index-range superset, and a
/// direct call to a refcount-transparent callee (rule T) is not opaque.
/// Everything the old form accepted, this form accepts.
///
/// What ADR-0068's loop form still deliberately refuses: a retain or a
/// frontier release ON a cycle. The retain-and-release-both-inside-one-
/// iteration shape (both in the same loop body, pair complete before the
/// back edge) is NOT accepted -- it needs an alternation argument ("each
/// retain occurrence is followed by exactly one frontier occurrence before
/// the next retain occurrence") this pass does not currently make, and the
/// one live instance (json parseArray's `Retain tail`) is independently
/// blocked by an aliasing store-release inside the interval, so there is no
/// measured case the missing argument would recover (GAP-0067).

  // `freshRoots` holds vids that are, AT THE CURRENT INSTRUCTION,
  // provably the ONLY reference to their object anywhere in the program:
  // defined IN THIS BLOCK by an `Alloc` (a fresh header nothing has seen,
  // file-header rule 5) or by a direct `Call` to a callee in the module's
  // returns-fresh set (`computeReturnsFreshCallees`: the callee-chain
  // allocated it and let no reference survive the return), and not since
  // used in any way that could create a second reference. `derivedOf`
  // maps interior pointers (`PtrOffset`/`PtrIndex` results) back to their
  // fresh root, so an interior pointer escaping is treated as the object
  // escaping.
  //
  // The tracking is deliberately BLOCK-LOCAL and dies at the block end: a
  // vid defined fresh in an earlier block would need every path between
  // its definition and this block re-checked for escapes, which is a
  // dataflow this pass does not have. Conservative refusal, not a
  // soundness need -- recorded in ADR-0072 as the first place to widen if
  // a measured shape wants it.
  //
  // WHAT KILLS FRESHNESS -- the sweep below, run for every instruction.
  // Everything except a use this pass can PROVE creates no reference:
  // `Retain v`/`Release v` (count traffic, no new reference -- the
  // pending-pair machinery is exactly these), `ICmp` (address read),
  // `Load` through it, `Store` INTO it, and the `PtrOffset`/`PtrIndex`
  // derivations themselves. A `Store` of the vid AS THE VALUE, an
  // appearance as any call's argument, a branch argument, a weak op, and
  // -- via the default arm over `referencedValueIds` -- every instruction
  // this sweep has never heard of: all kill. The default's polarity is
  // the safe one: an unknown use makes the vid NOT fresh, so a future
  // instruction nobody teaches this sweep about costs elision, never

        // Step (1)'s justification, CORRECTED by the 2026-08-27 audit --
        // this comment used to say "releases are pure decrements,
        // decrements commute", and that sentence is FALSE: a `Release`
        // that hits zero runs a destructor cascade, so real code executes
        // between "adjacent" releases and the instruction sequences do
        // NOT commute. What is actually true, and what the rule stands
        // on, is two narrower facts:
        //
        //   (a) END-OF-RUN COUNTS ARE ORDER-INDEPENDENT. By induction
        //       over the acyclic ownership graph: an object's total
        //       decrement from the run is its explicit releases plus one
        //       per dying holder, and dying is decided by those totals,
        //       not by the order they arrive in (a strong cycle reaches
        //       zero under neither order). So an object is freed by the
        //       run iff the original order freed it.
        //   (b) A DEATH MOVED EARLIER WITHIN THE RUN IS UNOBSERVABLE,
        //       because NO USE FOLLOWS it before the orders reconverge:
        //       adjacency means literally nothing executes between the
        //       run's releases except the releases themselves and their
        //       cascades, and by (a) any use AFTER the run of an object
        //       the run kills was already a use-after-free in the
        //       original program. Adjacency's real job is guaranteeing
        //       no use is INTERLEAVED -- it is the checkable proxy for
        //       the load-bearing no-use-follows premise, not a commute
        //       property. The pass checks the proxy because under it the
        //       premise holds a fortiori (there is nothing between the
        //       releases at all); a future widening that admits non-ARC
        //       instructions into a run would have to check the premise
        //       itself.
        //
        // DESTRUCTOR PREMISE, load-bearing for (b): this is sound while
        // destructors are compiler-synthesized field-release cascades
        // and nothing else (ADR-0022) -- a destructor that could
        // `WeakLoad` the affected object (e.g. future user-defined
        // destructors, spec §3) would OBSERVE death time from inside the

          // boundary is invalidated here), so the refcounts of the
          // original and transformed programs agree AT every boundary,
          // and within a gap the transformed count only ever rises from a
          // boundary value that the original program already guaranteed
          // to be >= 1. So it can never reach zero inside the interval.
          //
          // Note what that argument does NOT mention: where dcc-lower
          // chooses to put `_releaseHeapLocals`, or whether the last use
          // of a value happens to precede the releases. GAP-0054 recorded
          // that the ONLY thing standing between pass 3 and a
          // use-after-free was that ordering -- a property of a different
          // file, asserted nowhere. This invariant is local to the pass
          // and holds whatever order lowering emits.
          // NOT NARROWED BY AN ALIAS ANALYSIS. This is blunt, it is not
          // free, and the measurement is in ADR-0063 rather than hidden:
          // across every example, the conformance suite and all four
          // benchmarks that exist on main, exactly THREE pairs stop being
          // elided -- `json`'s `parseArray`, `m2-loopheap`'s `lastKept`
          // and `m3-generic-class`'s `boxNode` -- and the first of those
          // costs a measured +4% on the json benchmark (two interleaved
          // A/B runs, 600 samples a side: +4.5% and +4.2%).
          //
          // The obvious narrowing was tried and REJECTED ON ITS NUMBERS,
          // not skipped. A pending retain on a value defined by `Alloc`
